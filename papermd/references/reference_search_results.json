      "title": "Terminological Resources for Biologically Inspired Design and Biomimetics: Evaluation of the Potential for Ontology Reuse",
      "abstract": "Biomimetics aims to learn from living systems to develop innovative technical artefacts. As it transcends disciplinary boundaries and needs to integrate both biological and technological knowledge, a domain ontology for biomimetics would be highly desirable. So far, several terminological resources have been designed to support the biomimetic development process. This paper examines nine resources for Biologically Inspired Design and biomimetics, including taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. Their benefits and limitations for structuring or organising biomimetic knowledge are evaluated against nine criteria, including availability, clarity, and machine readability. Our analysis shows that existing terminological resources have little to no potential for reuse due to inconsistent structure, ambiguous class labels, lack of standardisation, and lack of availability. Furthermore, no resource adequately represents biomimetic knowledge, as all resources suffer from limitations in content representation, reusability, or infrastructure. In particular, an adequate domain ontology for supporting biomimetic development is lacking; we discuss the desiderata for such an ontology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThere is an ongoing genetic flow from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome. The mitochondrial sequences that have integrated into the nuclear genome have been shown to be drivers of evolutionary processes and cancerous transformations. In addition to their fundamental biological importance, these sequences have significant consequences for genome assembly and phylogenetic and forensic analyses as well. Previously, our research group developed a computational pipeline that provides a uniform way of identifying these sequences in mammalian genomes. In this paper, we publish MANUDB:the MAmmalian NUclear mitochondrial sequences DataBase, which makes the results of our pipeline publicly accessible. With MANUDB one can retrieve and visualize mitochondrial genome fragments that have been integrated into the nuclear genome of mammalian species.\n\nDatabase URL: manudb.streamlit.app",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nSummary\n\nModern biological research critically depends on public databases. The introduction and propagation of errors within and across databases can lead to wasted resources as scientists are led astray by bad data or have to conduct expensive validation experiments. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence systems threatens to compound this problem owing to the ease with which massive volumes of synthetic data can be generated. We provide an overview of several key issues that occur within the biological data ecosystem and make several recommendations aimed at reducing data errors and their propagation. We specifically highlight the critical importance of improved educational programs aimed at biologists and life scientists that emphasize best practices in data engineering. We also argue for increased theoretical and empirical research on data provenance, error propagation, and on understanding the impact of errors on analytic pipelines. Furthermore, we recommend enhanced funding for the stewardship and maintenance of public biological databases.\n\nAvailability and implementation\n\nNot applicable.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nGymnosperms are a clade of non-flowering plants that include about 1000 living species. Due to their complex genomes and lack of genomic resources, functional annotation in genomics and transcriptomics on gymnosperms suffers from limitations. Here we present gymnotoa-db, which is a novel, publicly accessible relational database designed to facilitate functional annotation in gymnosperms. This database stores non-redundant records of gymnosperm proteins, encompassing taxonomic and functional information. The complementary software, gymnotoa-app, enables users to download gymnotoa-db and execute a comprehensive functional annotation pipeline for high-throughput sequencing-derived DNA or cDNA sequences. gymnotoa-app's user-friendly interface and efficient algorithms streamline the functional annotation process, making it an invaluable tool for researchers studying gymnosperms. We compared gymnotoa-app's performance against other annotation tools utilizing disparate reference databases. Our results demonstrate gymnotoa-app's superior ability to accurately annotate gymnosperm transcripts, recovering a greater number of transcripts and unique, non-redundant Gene Ontology terms. gymnotoa-db's distinctive features include comprehensive coverage with a non-redundant dataset of gymnosperm protein sequences, robust functional information that integrates data from multiple ontology systems, including GO, KEGG, EC, and MetaCYC, while keeping the taxonomic context, including Arabidopsis homologs.\n\n Database URL: https://blogs.upm.es/gymnotoa-db/2024/09/19/gymnotoa-app/",

      "abstract": "Introduction\n\n Genetically enhanced microorganisms have wide applications in different fields and the increasing availability of omics data has enabled the development of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), which are essential tools in synthetic biology. Bartonella quintana str. Toulouse, a facultative intracellular parasite, presents a small genome and the ability to grow in axenic culture, making it a potential candidate for genome reduction and synthetic biology applications. This study aims to reconstruct and analyze the metabolic network of B. quintana to optimize its growth conditions for laboratory use.\n\nMethods\n\nA metabolic reconstruction of B. quintana was performed using genome annotation tools (RAST and ModelSEED), followed by refinement using multiple databases (KEGG, BioCyc, BRENDA). Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) was conducted to optimize biomass production, and in-silico knockouts were performed to evaluate growth yield under different media conditions. Additionally, experimental validation was carried out by testing modified culture media and performing proteomic analyses to identify metabolic adaptations.\n\nResults\n\nFBA simulations identified key metabolic requirements, including 2-oxoglutarate as a crucial compound for optimal growth. In-silico knockouts of transport genes revealed their essentiality in nutrient uptake. Experimental validation confirmed the role of 2-oxoglutarate and other nutrients in improving bacterial growth, though unexpected decreases in viability were observed under certain supplemented conditions. Proteomic analysis highlighted differential expression of proteins associated with cell wall integrity and metabolic regulation\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThis study represents a step toward developing B. quintana as a viable chassis for synthetic biology applications. The reconstructed metabolic model provides a comprehensive understanding of B. quintana's metabolic capabilities, identifying essential pathways and growth limitations. While metabolic predictions align with experimental results in key aspects, further refinements are needed to enhance model accuracy and optimize growth conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nOur understanding of biology and medicinal sciences augmented by advances in data structures and algorithms has resulted in proliferation of thousands of open-sourced resources, tools, and websites that are made by the scientific community to access, process, store, and visualize biological data. However, such data have become increasingly complex and heterogeneous, leading to an entangled web of relationships and external identifiers. Despite emergence of infrastructure such as data lakes, the scientists are still responsible for the time consuming and costly exercise to find, extract, clean, prepare, and maintain such data sources while following the FAIR principles. To better understand the complexity, we lay down a representation of the mainstream data ecosystem, describing the natural relationships and concepts found in biology. Built upon it and the fundamental principles of data unicity and atomicity, we introduce BioRels, an automated and standardized data preparation workstream aiming at improving reproducibility and speed for all scientists and handling up to 145 billion data points. BioRels allows complex querying capabilities across several data sources seamlessly and provides an exchange format, BIORJ, to export and import data with all its dependency and metadata. At last, we describe the advantages, limitations, applications, and perspectives of a future approach BioRels-KB to expand future data preparation capabilities.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Naturally occurring DNA inversion systems play an important role in the generation of genetic variation and adaptation in prokaryotes. Shufflon invertase (SI) Rci from plasmid R64, recognizing asymmetric sfx sites, has been adopted as a tool for synthetic biology. However, the availability of a single enzyme with moderate rates of recombination has hampered the more widespread use of SIs. We identified 14 previously untested SI genes and their sfx sites in public databases. We established an assay based on single-molecule sequencing that allows the quantification of the inversion rates of these enzymes and determined cross-recognition to identify orthogonal SI/sfx pairs. We describe SI enzymes with substantially improved shuffling rates when expressed in an inducible manner in E. coli. Our findings will facilitate the use of SIs in engineering biology where synthetic shufflons enable the generation of millions of sequence variants in vivo for applications such as barcoding or experimental selection.",

      "abstract": "Fungi, especially filamentous fungi, are a relatively understudied, biotechnologically useful resource with incredible potential for commercial applications. These multicellular eukaryotic organisms have long been exploited for their natural production of useful commodity chemicals and proteins such as enzymes used in starch processing, detergents, food and feed production, pulping and paper making and biofuels production. The ability of filamentous fungi to use a wide range of feedstocks is another key advantage. As chassis organisms, filamentous fungi can express cellular machinery, and metabolic and signal transduction pathways from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. Their genomes abound with novel genetic elements and metabolic processes that can be harnessed for biotechnology applications. Synthetic biology tools are becoming inexpensive, modular, and expansive while systems biology is beginning to provide the level of understanding required to design increasingly complex synthetic systems. This review covers the challenges of working in filamentous fungi and offers a perspective on the approaches needed to exploit fungi as microbial cell factories.",

      "title": "History of Biological Databases, Their Importance, and Existence in Modern Scientific and Policy Context",
      "abstract": "With the development of genome sequencing technologies, the amount of data produced has greatly increased in the last two decades. The abundance of digital sequence information (DSI) has provided research opportunities, improved our understanding of the genome, and led to the discovery of new solutions in industry and medicine. It has also posed certain challenges, i.e., how to store and handle such amounts of data. This, coupled with the need for convenience, international cooperation, and the possibility of independent validation, has led to the establishment of numerous databases. Spearheaded with the idea that data obtained with public funds should be available to the public, open access has become the predominant mode of accession. However, the increasing popularity of commercial genetic tests brings back the topic of data misuse, and patient's privacy. At the previous United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15, 2022), an issue of the least-developed countries exploiting their natural resources while providing DSI and the most-developed countries benefitting from this was raised. It has been proposed that financial renumeration for the data could help protect biodiversity. With the goal of introducing the topic to those interested in utilizing biological databases, in this publication, we present the history behind the biological databases, their necessity in today's scientific world, and the issues that concern them and their content, while providing scientific and policy context in relation to United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP16, 21.10:1.11.24).",

Chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid were detected as major constituents in the methanol extracts of P. tuberosa flower (12.47 and 25.31 microg/g), aerial part (30.95 and 47.82 microg/g) and root (9.79 and 32.56 microg/g). The main vitamins in the extracts were vitamins B3, C, and E. The main constituents of the essential oils from flowers and aerial parts were n-octacosane (14.34% and 25.66%) and hexahydro farnesyl acetone (13.89% and 18.75%). Flower methanol extract exhibited the highest antioxidant activity according to beta-carotene-linoleic acid, ABTS (2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) and CUPRAC (Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity) methods with IC50 values of 48.35 +- 0.84, 51.93 +- 0.85 and 65.43 +- 0.27 microg/mL, respectively. The roots hexane extract (IC50:103.2 +- 0.99 microg/mL) showed greater alpha-glucosidase inhibition than acarbose (IC50:128.5 +- 0.62 microg/mL). The anti-urease effect of both essential oils were higher compared to all the extracts, and the essential oil of the flowers demonstrated significant butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity. This study contributes to the traditional therapeutic uses of P. tuberosa and emphasizes its value in the development of new therapeutic agents exhibiting antioxidant and anti-diabetic activity.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of transformer neural networks has significantly enhanced the performance of sentence similarity models. However, these models often struggle with highly discriminative tasks and generate sub-optimal representations of complex documents such as peer-reviewed scientific literature. With the increased reliance on retrieval augmentation and search, representing structurally and thematically-varied research documents as concise and descriptive vectors is crucial. This study improves upon the vector embeddings of scientific text by assembling domain-specific datasets using co-citations as a similarity metric, focusing on biomedical domains. We introduce a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) extension pipeline applied to pretrained BERT models, where every multi-layer perceptron section is copied into distinct experts. Our MoE variants are trained to classify whether two publications are cited together (co-cited) in a third paper based on their scientific abstracts across multiple biological domains. Notably, because of our unique routing scheme based on special tokens, the throughput of our extended MoE system is exactly the same as regular transformers. This holds promise for versatile and efficient One-Size-Fits-All transformer networks for encoding heterogeneous biomedical inputs. Our methodology marks advancements in representation learning and holds promise for enhancing vector database search and compilation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) has been in place in many parts of the world. This fits in very well to the frailty index calculation proposed by Rockwood and thus a frailty index can potentially be generated automatically from an EHR database. Therefore, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) attempted to develop an electronic frailty index (HK eFI), by employing thirty-eight health variables from her own EHR database. METHODS: Five cohorts of patients aged 60 years or above ever attended any services provided by the Hong Kong HA in the year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, were included. The HK eFI trajectory with ageing, generated by the five cohorts, were compared to the one described by Rockwood's group. Following the UK eFI method, 4 levels of frailty were categorized, and they were examined whether they were related to mortality, readmission rate and hospitalization patient days. RESULTS: Each successive cohort consisted of increasing number of patients aged 60 years or above. (2015, 1.14 million; 2016, 1.19 million; 2017,1.25 million; 2018, 1.31 million; 2019, 1.38 million). The gradients of the five trajectories ranged from 0.035 to 0.037, representing an increase in FI approximately 3.6 % annually. The intercept of the curves converged at 0.1, representing the FI at age 60 years was 0.1. Compared to the fit group, the adjusted hazard ratios of mortality of the mild, moderate and severe frail group were 1.77, 3.31 and 6.65 respectively and they were all statistically higher than the fit group. (p < 0.005) Likewise, there was a stepwise increase in readmission rate and hospital patient days utilization with increasing frailty levels. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to develop an eFI and a biological age trajectory from a large EHR database with local adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe scale of modern datasets has necessitated innovations to solve even the most traditional and fundamental of computational problems. Set membership and set cardinality are both examples of simple queries that, for large enough datasets, quickly become challenging using traditional approaches. Interestingly, we find a need for these innovations within the field of biology. Despite the vast differences among living organisms, there exist functions so critical to life that they are conserved in the genomes and proteomes across seemingly unrelated species. Regular expressions (regexes) can serve as a convenient way to represent these conserved sequences compactly. However, despite the strong theoretical foundation and maturity of tools available, the state-of-the-art regex search falls short of what is necessary to quickly scan an enormous database of biological sequences. In this work, we describe a novel algorithm for regex search that reduces the search space by leveraging a recently developed compact data structure for set membership, the hierarchical interleaved bloom filter. We show that the runtime of our method combined with a traditional search outperforms state-of-the-art tools.",

      "abstract": "Advanced predictive modeling approaches have harnessed data to fuel important innovations at all stages of drug development. However, the need for a machine-readable drug product library which consolidates many aspects of formulation design and performance remains largely unmet. This study presents a scripted, reproducible approach to database curation and explores its potential to streamline oral medicine development. The Product Information files for all centrally authorized drug products containing a small molecule active ingredient were retrieved programmatically from the European Medicines Agency Web site. Text processing isolated relevant information, including the maximum clinical dose, dosage form, route of administration, excipients, and pharmacokinetic performance. Chemical and bioactivity data were integrated through automated linking to external curated databases. The capability of this database to inform oral medicine development was assessed in the context of drug-likeness evaluation, excipient selection, and prediction of oral fraction absorbed. Existing filters of drug-likeness, such as the Rule of Five, were found to poorly capture the chemical space of marketed oral drug products. Association rule learning identified frequent patterns in tablet formulation compositions that can be used to establish excipient combinations that have seen clinical success. Binary prediction models of oral fraction absorbed constructed exclusively from regulatory data achieved acceptable performance (balanced accuracytest = 0.725), demonstrating its modelability and potential for use during early stage molecule prioritization tasks.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nCurrent publications that are shaping public perception repeatedly claim that residues of plant protection products (PPP) in the environment demonstrate gaps in assessing the exposure and effects of PPP, allegedly revealing the inability of the European regulatory system to prevent environmental contamination and damage such as biodiversity decline. The hypothesis is that environmental risk assessments rely on inappropriate predictive models that underestimate exposure and do not explicitly account for the impact of combinations of environmental stressors and physiological differences in stress responses. This article puts this criticism into context to allow for a more balanced evaluation of the European regulatory system for PPP. There is broad consensus that the decline in biodiversity is real. This article analyzed current literature for causes of this decline and of chemical contamination. The main drivers identified were land use changes and structural uniformity of agricultural landscapes or multiple contaminants emitted by various sources such as wastewater discharge systems. Comparing measured environmental concentrations from published monitoring studies with exposure predictions from the regulatory risk assessment reveals only slight occasional exceedances for a few environmental scenarios and compounds. Therefore, the call for greater conservatism in the European authorization process for PPPs will not lead to an improvement in the environmental situation. We suggest enhancing landscape diversity through the European Union Common Agricultural Policy and reducing contamination from wastewater and farmyard effluents. The current regulatory risk management toolbox should be expanded to include flexible localized mitigation measures and treatment options to reduce applied amounts and off-target exposure.\n\nThis article puts recent criticisms of the European regulatory system for plant protection into context to allow a more balanced assessment of the European authorisation process.\n\n Key points  ",

These cases mainly came from the southern regions of Mauritania, such as Assaba (n = 15) and Grogol (n = 12).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe study confirms the ongoing presence of CL in Mauritania, particularly in the southern areas and provides confirmation of the presence of L. major. It underscores the urgent need to locally develop appropriate diagnostic tools and to authorize the commercialization of meglumine antimoniate in the country. Further studies should be conducted to better determine the disease burden, identify vectors and reservoirs and evaluate therapeutic options.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-10716-w.",

      "title": "mirTarCLASH: a comprehensive miRNA target database based on chimeric read-based experiments",
      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) can target messenger RNAs to control their degradation or translation repression effects. Therefore, identifying the target and binding sites of different miRNAs is essential for understanding miRNA functions. To investigate these interactions, researchers have employed the cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH-seq) and similar CLASH-like approaches to generate chimeric reads formed by miRNAs and their targeting segments. These chimeric reads allow for the direct extraction of both the miRNA-target gene pairs and their corresponding binding sites. Nevertheless, these studies lack user-friendly platforms for researchers to investigate these interactions efficiently, thus hindering scientists' ability to explore miRNA functions. To address this gap, we developed mirTarCLASH, a comprehensive database that deposits 502 061/322 707/224 452 unique hybrid reads from human/mouse/worm miRNA chimeric read-based experiments. In mirTarCLASH, the chimera analysis algorithm ChiRA and two distinct binding site inference tools, RNAup and miRanda, were adopted to facilitate the exploration of miRNA-target pairs derived from CLASH-like experiments. Compared with existing similar repositories, mirTarCLASH further enables several confidence evaluation filters with visualization functions for the extracted results. The results can be further refined based on the key properties of the miRNA targeting sites, including read depths, numbers of supporting algorithms, and cross-linking-induced mutations, to enhance confidence levels. In addition, these miRNA-binding sites are visually represented through an integrated transcript atlas. Finally, we demonstrated the biological applicability of mirTarCLASH via the well-characterized example interaction between cel-let-7-5p and lin-41 in Caenorhabditis elegans, showcasing the potential of mirTarCLASH to provide novel insights for subsequent experimental research designs.

      "title": "Empowering Global AMR Research Community: Interactive GIS dashboards for AMR data analysis and informed decision-making",
      "abstract": "Background\n\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) poses a global public health challenge, necessitating advanced tools to support data analysis, and visualization. This study introduces interactive Geographic Information System (GIS) dashboards as innovative platforms for AMR data analysis and visualization, offering comprehensive insights into resistance patterns, and geographic distribution across multiple countries, with a specific focus on Africa.\n\nMethods\n\nThree GIS dashboards were developed to address key objectives. The first integrates over 860,000 ATLAS data points from 83 countries, providing an interactive platform. Users can filter data by variables such as country, year, and region, enhancing data accessibility and visualization. The second dashboard focuses on the ATLAS dataset for Kenya and Uganda, incorporating detailed variables such as species, sample sources, and resistance phenotypes. The third involves Kampala, Uganda, to fill data gaps, enabling localized analyses through interactive features like geographic mapping and sample breakdowns by year.\n\nResults\n\nSub-Saharan Africa faces three major challenges in handling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data: limited accessibility for non-technical users, inefficiencies in processing large datasets, and insufficient longitudinal data for analysis. The introduction of interactive dashboards significantly improved AMR data visualization and interpretation across different scales. The global AMR dashboard effectively mapped geographical trends, uncovering critical data gaps, particularly the scarcity of AMR records from Africa. The Kenya and Uganda dashboard revealed key resistance patterns, highlighting the ineffectiveness of Ceftriaxone, Erythromycin, Levofloxacin, and Ampicillin against E. coli isolates. Additionally, the Kampala-specific dashboard, developed using simulated data, demonstrated the potential for localized AMR visualization, providing valuable insights where real-world data is limited. Across all platforms, the dashboards' interactive features enhanced data accessibility and streamlined trend identification, making AMR insights more interpretable, especially for researchers in Sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nConclusions\n\nInteractive GIS dashboards enhance AMR data analysis in Sub-Saharan Africa by improving accessibility, efficiently handling large datasets, and addressing data gaps. Unlike spreadsheets such as Excel, which struggle with large datasets due to computer constraints, dashboards offer dynamic visualization, real-time updates, and intuitive data exploration.\n\nPlain Language Summary\n\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is increasingly serious global health issue, making it harder to treat common infections due to the reduced effectiveness of antibiotics. To address this challenge, researchers, healthcare providers, and professionals need tools to better understand AMR. This study introduces an interactive tool in the form of Geographic Information System (GIS) dashboards, which allow users to explore and analyze AMR datasets. The first objective was to create a global map that tracks antibiotic usage and resistance trends across multiple countries, enabling users to zoom in on specific areas, such as countries or years, for more detailed insights from ATLAS dataset. The second objective was to develop maps for Kenya and Uganda, highlighting the unique AMR challenges faced in these countries. The third goal focused on using this tool to address data gaps in Kampala, Uganda, and help users analyze AMR trends. These interactive maps are highly valuable. The global map reveals trends and identifies areas where data is lacking, especially in Africa. The maps for Kenya and Uganda show concerning resistance levels, where antibiotics are becoming ineffective against bacteria like E. coli. The Kampala map demonstrates how the tool can help provide a more detailed analysis of local AMR issues. Overall, these maps make it easier for experts to explore AMR data and identify key trends. In simple terms, these GIS dashboards are powerful tools for communicating and raising awareness about AMR. They allow us to visualize the spread of resistance and explore detailed AMR data. These interactive dashboards could play a crucial role in the global effort to combat AMR.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nExtensive studies have revealed the ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity, but little is known about how it is inherited between generations and the genetic architecture of its transgenerational inheritance. To address these issues, we design a mapping study by growing Arabidopsis thaliana RILs in high- and low-light environments and further growing their offspring RILs from each maternal light environment in the same contrasting environments. This tree-like design of the controlled ecological experiment provides a framework for analysing the genetic regulation of phenotypic plasticity and its non-genetic inheritance. We implement the computational approach of functional mapping to identify specific QTLs for transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. By estimating and comparing the plastic response of leaf-number growth trajectories to light environment between generations, we find that the maternal environment affects phenotypic plasticity, whereas transgenerational plasticity is shaped by the offspring environment. The genetic architecture underlying the light-induced change of leaf number not only changes from parental to offspring generations, but also depends on the maternal environment the parental generation experienced and the offspring environment the offspring generation is experiencing. Most plasticity QTLs are annotated to the genomic regions of candidate genes for specific biological functions. Our computational-experimental design provides a unique insight into dissecting the non-genetic and genetic mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity shaping plant adaptation and evolution in various forms.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is \"learnable\" and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.",

      "abstract": "Introduction:\n\nIn response to continuous advancements in synthetic biotechnologies and in the availability of synthetic nucleic acids to the biological research community since the publication of the 2010 HHS synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) screening framework, the U.S. government undertook a comprehensive and stakeholder-driven review and revision process. This culminated in the publication of a new screening framework for synthetic nucleic acids in October 2023, followed by an Executive Order directing departments and agencies of the U.S. government to take certain measures in support of implementing the screening framework. This review provides an overview of the process by which stakeholder comments were considered and by which the 2023 screening framework was drafted. A summary of expected impacts on the life sciences research community is also provided.\n\nMethods:\n\nComments were solicited from synthetic biology stakeholders through the publication of two Federal Register Notices, in 2020 and 2022. The 2020 Notice elicited 15 unique responses totaling 220 pages, and the 2022 Notice elicited 26 unique responses totaling 79 pages. These were considered by a deliberative interagency group, resulting in a revised screening framework in 2023.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion:\n\nThe adoption of the 2023 screening framework, and related provisions in the Executive Order that followed, will impact researchers and biosafety officers across the U.S. bioeconomy. For instance, this screening framework is no longer limited in its recommendations to providers of synthetic dsDNA containing sequences unique to regulated pathogens or toxins, but now includes recommendations to all entities involved in the sale, use, and transfer of all forms of synthetic nucleic acids encoding genetic sequences that contribute to pathogenicity or toxicity:whether from regulated agents or not. Biosafety professionals are emerging as a critical resource for establishing and fostering a culture of biosecurity surrounding synthetic nucleic acids containing these high consequence genetic sequences.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe work presented is significant because the scope of the 2010 screening framework has been expanded to include roles and responsibilities for new entities across the life sciences research landscape. This will likely impact biosafety professionals, who may be well positioned in their institutions to coordinate these new responsibilities.",

      "abstract": "Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing field enabling scientific experiments via computer models and simulations. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary growth in biological databases. Therefore, it is extremely important to propose effective methods and algorithms for the fast and accurate processing of biological data. Sequence comparisons are the best way to investigate and understand the biological functions and evolutionary relationships between genes on the basis of the alignment of two or more DNA sequences in order to maximize the identity level and degree of similarity. This paper presents a new version of the pairwise DNA sequences alignment algorithm, based on a new method called CAT, where a dependency with a previous match and the closest neighbor are taken into consideration to increase the uniqueness of the CAT profile and to reduce possible collisions, i.e., two or more sequence with the same CAT profiles. This makes the proposed algorithm suitable for finding the exact match of a concrete DNA sequence in a large set of DNA data faster. In order to enable the usage of the profiles as sequence metadata, CAT profiles are generated once prior to data uploading to the database. The proposed algorithm consists of two main stages: CAT profile calculation depending on the chosen benchmark sequences and sequence comparison by using the calculated CAT profiles. Improvements in the generation of the CAT profiles are detailed and described in this paper. Block schemes, pseudo code tables, and figures were updated according to the proposed new version and experimental results. Experiments were carried out using the new version of the CAT method for DNA sequence alignment and different datasets. New experimental results regarding collisions, speed, and efficiency of the suggested new implementation are presented. Experiments related to the performance comparison with Needleman-Wunsch were re-executed with the new version of the algorithm to confirm that we have the same performance. A performance analysis of the proposed algorithm based on the CAT method against the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which has a complexity of O(n) and is widely used for biological data searching, was performed. The impact of prior matching dependencies on uniqueness for generated CAT profiles is investigated. The experimental results from sequence alignment demonstrate that the proposed CAT method-based algorithm exhibits minimal deviation, which can be deemed negligible if such deviation is considered permissible in favor of enhanced performance. It should be noted that the performance of the CAT algorithm in terms of execution time remains stable, unaffected by the length of the analyzed sequences. Hence, the primary benefit of the suggested approach lies in its rapid processing capabilities in large-scale sequence alignment, a task that traditional exact algorithms would require significantly more time to perform.

In order to lower the carbon emissions of UHPC, this study suggests a machine learning-based strategy for optimizing the mix proportion of UHPC. To accomplish this, an artificial neural network (ANN) is initially applied to develop a prediction model for the compressive strength and slump flow of UHPC. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to reduce the carbon emissions of UHPC while taking into account the strength, slump flow, component content, component proportion, and absolute volume of UHPC as constraint conditions. The outcome is then supported by the results of the experiments. In comparison to the experimental results, the research findings show that the ANN model has excellent prediction accuracy with an error of less than 10%. The carbon emissions of UHPC are decreased to 688 kg/m3 after GA optimization, and the effect of optimization is substantial. The machine learning (ML) model can provide theoretical support for the optimization of various aspects of UHPC.",

Their recent use in DNA data storage systems has unique challenges, since the DNA storage channel deviates from the traditional Gaussian white noise erasure model considered in communication networks and has several restrictions as well as special properties. Thus, optimizing fountain codes to address these challenges promises to improve their overall usability in DNA data storage systems.

Synthetic biology holds the potential to enhance microalgae-based technologies by broadening the scope of treatment targets and improving pollutant removal rates. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the synthetic biology of microalgae, focusing on genetic engineering tools to facilitate the removal of inorganic (heavy metals and salinity) and organic (pesticides and plastics) compounds. The development of these tools is crucial for enhancing pollutant removal mechanisms through gene expression manipulation, DNA introduction into cells, and the generation of mutants with altered phenotypes. Additionally, the review discusses the principles of synthetic biology tools, emphasizing the significance of genetic engineering in targeting specific metabolic pathways and creating phenotypic changes. It also explores the use of precise engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs, to adapt genetic engineering to various microalgae species. The review concludes that there is much potential for synthetic biology based approaches for pollutant removal using microalgae, but there is a need for expansion of the tools involved, including the development of universal cloning toolkits for the efficient and rapid assembly of mutants and transgenic expression strains, and the need for adaptation of genetic engineering tools to a wider range of microalgae species.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nCreated with Biorender.com.",

      "abstract": "The expanding field of synthetic biology (synbio) supports new opportunities in the design of targeted bioproducts or modified microorganisms. However, this rapid development of synbio products raises concerns surrounding the potential risks of modified microorganisms contaminating unintended environments. These potential invasion risks require new bioinformatic tools to inform the design phase. EcoGenoRisk is a newly constructed computational risk assessment tool for invasiveness that aims to predict where synbio microorganisms may establish a population by screening for habitats of genetically similar microorganisms. The first module of the tool identifies genetically similar microorganisms and potential ecological relationships such as competition, mutualism, and inhibition. In total, 520 archaeal and 32,828 bacterial complete assembly genomes were analyzed to test the specificity and accuracy of the tool as well as to characterize the enzymatic profiles of different taxonomic lineages. Additionally, ecological relationships were analyzed to determine which would result in the greatest potential overlap between shared functional profiles. Notably, competition displayed the significantly highest overlap of shared functions between compared genomes. Overall, EcoGenoRisk is a flexible software pipeline that assists environmental risk assessors to query large databases of known microorganisms and prioritize follow-up bench scale studies.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shifted the spotlight from adult disease to gametogenesis and embryo developmental events, and these are greatly affected by various environmental chemicals, such as drugs, metabolites, pollutants, and others. Growing research has highlighted the critical importance of identifying and understanding the roles of chemicals in reproductive biology. However, the functions and mechanisms of chemicals in reproductive processes remain incomplete. We developed a comprehensive database called the Reproductive Chemical Database (RCDB) (https://yu.life.sjtu.edu.cn/ChenLab/RCDB) to facilitate research on chemicals in reproductive biology. This resource is founded on rigorous manual literature extraction and precise protein target prediction methodologies. This database focuses on the delineation of chemicals associated with phenotypes, diseases, or endpoints intricately associated with four important reproductive processes: female and male gamete generation, fertilization, and embryo development in human and mouse. The RCDB encompasses 93 sub-GO processes, and it revealed 1447 intricate chemical-biological process interactions. To date, the RCDB has meticulously cataloged and annotated 830 distinct chemicals, while also predicting 614 target proteins from a selection of 3800 potential candidates. Additionally, the RCDB offers an online predictive tool that empowers researchers to ascertain whether specific chemicals play discernible functional roles in these reproductive processes. The RCDB is an exhaustive, cross-platform, manually curated database, which provides a user-friendly interface to search, browse, and use reproductive processes modulators and their comprehensive related information. The RCDB will help researchers to understand the whole reproductive process and related diseases and it has the potential to promote reproduction research in the pharmacological and pathophysiological areas.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nNeoantigens have emerged as a promising area of focus in tumor immunotherapy, with several established strategies aiming to enhance their identification. Human leukocyte antigen class I molecules (HLA-I), which present intracellular immunopeptides to T cells, provide an ideal source for identifying neoantigens. However, solely relying on a mutation database generated through commonly used whole exome sequencing (WES) for the identification of HLA-I immunopeptides, may result in potential neoantigens being missed due to limitations in sequencing depth and sample quality.\n\nMethod\n\nIn this study, we constructed and evaluated an extended database for neoantigen identification, based on COSMIC mutation database. This study utilized mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic profiling to identify the HLA-I immunopeptidome enriched from HepG2 cell. HepG2 WES-based and the COSMIC-based mutation database were generated and utilized to identify HepG2-specific mutant immunopeptides.\n\nResult\n\nThe results demonstrated that COSMIC-based database identified 5 immunopeptides compared to only 1 mutant peptide identified by HepG2 WES-based database, indicating its effectiveness in identifying mutant immunopeptides. Furthermore, HLA-I affinity of the mutant immunopeptides was evaluated through NetMHCpan and peptide-docking modeling to validate their binding to HLA-I molecules, demonstrating the potential of mutant peptides identified by the COSMIC-based database as neoantigens.\n\nConclusion\n\nUtilizing the COSMIC-based mutation database is a more efficient strategy for identifying mutant peptides from HLA-I immunopeptidome without significantly increasing the false positive rate. HepG2 specific WES-based database may exclude certain mutant peptides due to WES sequencing depth or sample heterogeneity. The COSMIC-based database can effectively uncover potential neoantigens within the HLA-I immunopeptidomes.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-023-04821-0.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nSoybean is a globally important crop for food, feed, oil, and nitrogen fixation. A variety of multi-omics studies have been carried out, generating datasets ranging from genotype to phenotype. In order to efficiently utilize these data for basic and applied research, a soybean multi-omics database with extensive data coverage and comprehensive data analysis tools was established. The Soybean Omics Database (SoyOD) integrates important new datasets with existing public datasets to form the most comprehensive collection of soybean multi-omics information. Compared to existing soybean databases, SoyOD incorporates an extensive collection of novel data derived from the deep-sequencing of 984 germplasms, 162 novel transcriptomic datasets from seeds at different developmental stages, 53 phenotypic datasets, and more than 2500 phenotypic images. In addition, SoyOD integrates existing data resources, including 59 assembled genomes, genetic variation data from 3904 soybean accessions, 225 sets of phenotypic data, and 1097 transcriptomic sequences covering 507 different tissues and treatment conditions. Moreover, SoyOD can be used to mine candidate genes for important agronomic traits, as shown in a case study on plant height. Additionally, powerful analytical and easy-to-use toolkits enable users to easily access the available multi-omics datasets, and to rapidly search genotypic and phenotypic data in a particular germplasm. The novelty, comprehensiveness, and user-friendly features of SoyOD make it a valuable resource for soybean molecular breeding and biological research.

The massification of pathway data made available by numerous online databases in recent years has given rise to an important need for standardization of this data. The BioPAX format (Biological Pathway Exchange) emerged in 2010 as a solution for standardizing and exchanging pathway data across databases. BioPAX is a Semantic Web format associated to an ontology. It is highly expressive, allowing to finely describe biological pathways at the molecular and cellular levels, but the associated intrinsic complexity may be an obstacle to its widespread adoption.\n\nHere, we report on the use of the BioPAX format in 2024. We compare how the different pathway databases use BioPAX to standardize their data and point out possible avenues for improvement to make full use of its potential. We also report on the various tools and software that have been developed to work with BioPAX data. Finally, we present a new concept of abstraction on BioPAX graphs that would allow to specifically target areas in a BioPAX graph needed for a specific analysis, thus differentiating the format suited for representation and the abstraction suited for contextual analysis.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nHighlights\n\nBioPAX meets its initial objectives.\n\nPathway databases differ in scope and in BioPAX pathway representation.\n\nBioPAX' complexity hinders its adoption by biologists and reasoning tool developers.",

      "abstract": "With the current progress in the 'design' and 'build' stages of the 'design-build-test-learn' cycle, many synthetic biology projects become 'test-limited'. Advances in the parallelization of microbes cultivations are of great aid, however, for many species down-scaling leaves a metabolic footprint. Yarrowia lipolytica is one such demanding yeast species, for which scaling-down inevitably leads to perturbations in phenotype development. Strictly aerobic metabolism, propensity for filamentation and adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces, spontaneous flocculation, and high acidification of media are just several characteristics that make the transfer of the micro-scale protocols developed for the other microbial species very challenging in this case. It is well recognized that without additional 'personalized' optimization, either MTP-based or single-cell-based protocols are useless for accurate studies of Y. lipolytica phenotypes. This review summarizes the progress in the scaling-down and parallelization of Y. lipolytica cultures, highlighting the challenges that occur most frequently and strategies for their overcoming. The problem of Y. lipolytica cultures down-scaling is illustrated by calculating the costs of micro-cultivations, and determining the unintentionally introduced, thus uncontrolled, variables. The key research into culturing Y. lipolytica in various MTP formats and micro- and pico-bioreactors is discussed. Own recently developed and carefully pre-optimized high-throughput cultivation protocol is presented, alongside the details from the optimization stage. We hope that this work will serve as a practical guide for those working with Y. lipolytica high-throughput screens.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12934-024-02465-3.",

Exploring the expression difference of iron metabolism-related genes in osteoporosis can provide a new target for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nMethods\n\nFirst, we used online databases to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to iron metabolism in patients with osteoporosis. The differential genes were comprehensively analyzed by bioinformatics method (GO, KEGG, GSEA, immune infiltration analysis, PPI). The expression levels of hub genes and important signaling pathways were verified by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 23 iron metabolism-related genes with significant differences were identified, which were enriched in \"regulation of protein dephosphorylation\" and \"negative regulation of protein dephosphorylation\". The GSEA results, heme metabolism and Myc targets v1 were among the top two pathways, both upregulated. The immune infiltration analysis revealed that the expressions of genes such as ABCA5, D2HGDH, GNAI2, and CTSW were correlated with the infiltration degree of significantly different cells. The PPI network contained 12 differentially expressed iron metabolism-related genes. Additionally, YWHAE, TGFB1, PPP1R15A, TOP2A, and CALR were mined as hub genes using the Cytoscape software. qRT PCR showed that the expression of TGF-beta1, YWHAE, TOP2A and CALR increased. We also verified the expression of related proteins and genes in the oxidative stress signaling pathway by qRT PCR and Western blotting. The results showed that Mob1, YAP and TAZ molecules were highly expressed at the gene and protein levels.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese differentially expressed iron metabolism-related genes could provide new potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12920-023-01779-2.",

This may be a consequence of the still embryonic stage of the literature on statistical software validation for computational biology. Our manuscript aims to advance this literature. Here, we describe, illustrate, and introduce new good practices for assessing the correctness of a model implementation with an emphasis on Bayesian methods.

Their methanol extracts were subjected to qualitative LC-MS analyses, resulting in the annotation of 28 different secondary metabolites, with 27 originating from A. orientalis, 25 from A. tinctoria and 23 from A. kotschyana. The detected metabolites are categorized into three chemical types: organic acids (2), flavonoids and their glycosides (17), and caffeic acid derivatives (9). Furthermore, the chemical profiles of the three species are discussed chemotaxonomically. Caffeic acid and its derivatives, along with glucosides of quercetin and kaempferol, were identified in all three studied species. Additionally, their total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined. The antioxidant capacity was evaluated through various chemical assays, as well as their in vitro enzyme inhibitory properties towards cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. The results showed that A. tinctoria exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity (211 mgTE/g extract in DPPH and 366 mgTE/g extract in ABTS), probably due to its high total phenolic (53.3 mgGAE/g extract) and flavonoid (20.8 mgRE/g extract) content, followed by A. kotschyana. These chemical and biological findings provide valuable insights for potential promising applications of the aerial parts of the species outside of the well-known uses of their roots.",

The massive increasing amount of data and new digital technologies promise to overcome them, but they necessitate careful data integration and data management to make them usable. The FAIRagro consortium is part of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany and will develop FAIR compliant infrastructure services for the agrosystems science community, which will be integrated in the existing research data infrastructure service landscape. Here we present the initial steps of designing and implementing the FAIRagro middleware infrastructure to connect existing data infrastructures. The middleware will feature services for the seamless data integration across diverse infrastructures. Data and metadata are streamlined for research in agrosystems science by downstream processing in the central FAIRagro Search and Inventory Portal and the data integration and analysis workflow system \"SciWIn\".",

Within crystallography and closely related subject areas, there is already a high level of conformance to the generally accepted FAIR principles (that data be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) through the adoption of common information exchange protocols by databases, publishers, instrument vendors, experimental facilities and software authors. Driven by the success within these domains, the IUCr has worked closely with CODATA (the Committee on Data of the International Science Council) to help develop the latter's commitment to cross-domain integration of discipline-specific data. The IUCr has, in particular, emphasized the need for standards relating to data quality and completeness as an adjunct to the FAIR data landscape. This can ensure definitive reusable data, which in turn can aid interoperability across domains.

      "abstract": " Introduction: The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept facilitates rapid hazard assessment for human health risks. AOPs are constantly evolving, their number is growing, and they are referenced in the AOP-Wiki database, which is supported by the OECD. Here, we present a study that aims at identifying well-defined biological areas, as well as gaps within the AOP-Wiki for future research needs. It does not intend to provide a systematic and comprehensive summary of the available literature on AOPs but summarizes and maps biological knowledge and diseases represented by the already developed AOPs (with OECD endorsed status or under validation).\n\n Methods: Knowledge from the AOP-Wiki database were extracted and prepared for analysis using a multi-step procedure. An automatic mapping of the existing information on AOPs (i.e., genes/proteins and diseases) was performed using bioinformatics tools (i.e., overrepresentation analysis using Gene Ontology and DisGeNET), allowing both the classification of AOPs and the development of AOP networks (AOPN).\n\n Results: AOPs related to diseases of the genitourinary system, neoplasms and developmental anomalies are the most frequently investigated on the AOP-Wiki. An evaluation of the three priority cases (i.e., immunotoxicity and non-genotoxic carcinogenesis, endocrine and metabolic disruption, and developmental and adult neurotoxicity) of the EU-funded PARC project (Partnership for the Risk Assessment of Chemicals) are presented. These were used to highlight under- and over-represented adverse outcomes and to identify and prioritize gaps for further research.\n\n Discussion: These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the adverse effects associated with the molecular events in AOPs, and aid in refining risk assessment for stressors and mitigation strategies. Moreover, the FAIRness (i.e., data which meets principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR)) of the AOPs appears to be an important consideration for further development.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nThe probability of motor deficits after stroke is relatively high. At the same time many studies have reported that acupuncture and rehabilitation therapy have a significant effect on the treatment of stroke.\n\nObjective\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical value of acupuncture and rehabilitation therapy on brain eloquent areas and neurological function in ischemic stroke.\n\nMethods\n\nSeven databases were electronically searched to screen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of different intervention methods (acupuncture, rehabilitation) in the treatment of ischemic stroke. The search time is from January 1, 2000 to April 20, 2023, and the search languages are limited to Chinese and English. Two researchers independently screened literature and extracted data. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 17 randomized controlled studies were included, including 699 patients, with a maximum sample size of 144 cases and a minimum sample size of 11 cases. Among them, 3 studies reported the brain function in SM1 area. The effective rate of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group [relative risk (OR) = 3.24, 95%CI: 1.49 to 7.05, P < 0.05]. The FMA score of patients in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group [mean difference (MD) = 4.79, 95% CI: 3.86 to 5.71, P < 0.00001]. The NIHSS score of patients in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group [mean difference (MD) = -4.12, 95% CI: -6.99 to -1.26, P < 0.05].None of studies reported adverse events.\n\nConclusions\n\nAcupuncture rehabilitation for ischemic stroke can activate corresponding brain functional areas and improve neurological deficits. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture rehabilitation treatment is better than that of basic western medicine treatment, and it is more effective in improving neurological deficits. At the same time, clinical research needs to use high-quality randomized double-blind controlled trials with more detailed and larger sample designs, long-term efficacy evaluation and evidence-based research methods.",

Recent research suggests that alterations in super-enhancer activity can contribute to the development and progression of various disorders. The aim of this research is to explore the multifaceted roles of super-enhancers in gene regulation and their significant implications for understanding and treating complex diseases. Here, we study and summarise the classification of super-enhancer constituents, their possible modes of interaction, and cross-regulation, including super-enhancer RNAs (seRNAs). We try to investigate the opportunity of SE dynamics prediction based on the hierarchy of enhancer single elements (enhancers) and their aggregated action. To further our understanding, we conducted an in silico experiment to compare and differentiate between super-enhancers and locus-control regions (LCRs), shedding light on the enigmatic relationship between LCRs and SEs within the human genome. Particular attention is paid to the classification of specific mechanisms and their diversity, exemplified by various oncological, cardiovascular, and immunological diseases, as well as an overview of several anti-SE therapies. Overall, the work presents a comprehensive analysis of super-enhancers across different diseases, aiming to provide insights into their regulatory roles and may act as a rationale for future clinical interventions targeting these regulatory elements.",

In the context of a synthetic carotenoid pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we focused on a phytoene synthase and three phytoene desaturases, which are difficult to study in vitro. We designed, built, and analyzed a collection of yeast strains mimicking substantial variations in substrate concentration by strategically manipulating the expression of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. We successfully determined in vivo Michaelis-Menten parameters (KM, Vmax, and kcat) for GGPP-converting phytoene synthase from absolute metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data, highlighting differences between in vivo and in vitro parameters. Leveraging the versatility of the same set of strains, we then extracted enzymatic parameters for two of the three phytoene desaturases. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of assessing enzymatic parameters directly in vivo, providing a novel perspective on the kinetic characteristics of enzymes in real cellular conditions.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe physiological significance of enzymatic parameters determined in classical in vitro settings vastly different from cellular conditions remains limited.

Generative AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics, research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data-intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information. This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support, while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care, this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics, security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition, this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt generative AI solutions within their organizations.",

      "title": "Two-factor authentication underpins the precision of the piRNA pathway",
      "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guides the DNA methylation of young, active transposons during germline development in male mice. piRNAs tether the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript, resulting in DNA methylation through SPOCD1 (refs. ). Transposon methylation requires great precision: every copy needs to be methylated but off-target methylation must be avoided. However, the underlying mechanisms that ensure this precision remain unknown. Here, we show that SPOCD1 interacts directly with SPIN1 (SPINDLIN1), a chromatin reader that primarily binds to H3K4me3-K9me3 (ref. ). The prevailing assumption is that all the molecular events required for piRNA-directed DNA methylation occur after the engagement of MIWI2. We find that SPIN1 expression precedes that of both SPOCD1 and MIWI2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that young LINE1 copies, but not old ones, are marked by H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and SPIN1 before the initiation of piRNA-directed DNA methylation. We generated a Spocd1 separation-of-function allele in the mouse that encodes a SPOCD1 variant that no longer interacts with SPIN1. We found that the interaction between SPOCD1 and SPIN1 is essential for spermatogenesis and piRNA-directed DNA methylation of young LINE1 elements. We propose that piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation requires a developmentally timed two-factor authentication process. The first authentication is the recruitment of SPIN1-SPOCD1 to the young LINE1 promoter, and the second is MIWI2 engagement with the nascent transcript. In summary, independent authentication events underpin the precision of piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation.\n\nIn male mouse germline development, the precise DNA methylation of young, active transposons requires a two-step process in which SPIN1 and SPOCD1 mark young LINE1 elements before the piRNA pathway triggers DNA methylation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nIntroduction\n\nExisting methods for morphological, organoleptic, and chemical authentication may not adequately ensure the accurate identification of plant species or guarantee safety. Herbal raw material authentication remains a major challenge in herbal medicine. Over the past decade, DNA barcoding, combined with an orthogonal approach integrating various testing methods for quality assurance, has emerged as a new trend in plant authentication.\n\nObjective\n\nThe review evaluates DNA barcoding and common alternative testing in plant-related sectors to enhance quality assurance and accurate authentication.\n\nMethod\n\nStudies were selected based on their relevance to the identification, quality assurance, and safety of herbal products. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, and relevant case studies from the last two decades focused on DNA barcoding, identification methods, and their applications. Exclusion criteria involved studies lacking empirical data, those not peer-reviewed, or those unrelated to the main focus. This ensured the inclusion of high-quality, pertinent sources while excluding less relevant studies.\n\nResults\n\nAn orthogonal approach refers to the use of multiple, independent methods that provide complementary information for more accurate plant identification and quality assurance. This reduces false positives or negatives by confirming results through different techniques, combining DNA barcoding with morphological analysis or chemical profiling. It enhances confidence in results, particularly in cases of potential adulteration or misidentification of plant materials.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study highlights the persistent challenges in assuring the quality, purity, and safety of plant materials. Additionally, it stresses the importance of incorporating DNA-based authentication alongside traditional methods, to enhance plant material identification.",

      "abstract": "Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft guidelines on \"prescription drug use-related software\" illustrate opportunities to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for DTx \"active ingredients\" also show improved outcomes. In this narrative review, we discuss how drug + digital combination therapies can impact translational research, drug discovery and development, generic drug repurposing, and gene therapies. Market-driven incentives to create drug-device combination products are illustrated by Humira  (adalimumab) facing a \"patent-cliff\" competition with cheaper and more effective biosimilars seamlessly integrated with DTx. In conclusion, pharma and biotech companies, patients, and healthcare professionals will benefit from accelerating integration of digital interventions with pharmacotherapies.",

Herein, we present StreptomeDB 4.0, a substantial update of the database that includes expanded content and several new features. Currently, StreptomeDB 4.0 contains over 8500 NPs originating from ~3900 streptomycetes, manually annotated from ~7600 PubMed-indexed peer-reviewed articles. The database was enhanced by two in-house developments: (i) automated literature-mined NP-protein relationships (hyperlinked to the CPRiL web server) and (ii) pharmacophore-based NP-protein interactions (predicted with the ePharmaLib dataset). Moreover, genome mining was supplemented through hyperlinks to the widely used antiSMASH database. To facilitate NP structural dereplication, interactive visualization tools were implemented, namely the JSpecView applet and plotly.js charting library for predicted nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectral data, respectively. Furthermore, both the backend database and the frontend web interface were redesigned, and several software packages, including PostgreSQL and Django, were updated to the latest versions. Overall, this comprehensive database serves as a vital resource for researchers seeking to delve into the metabolic intricacies of streptomycetes and discover novel therapeutics, notably antimicrobial agents.

Second, homologs of proteins of interest are identified quickly by using accelerated searches, usually in a few seconds. Once homologs are identified, fast.genomics can quickly show their prevalence across taxa, view their neighboring genes, or compare the prevalence of two different proteins.

The extensive and disparate data on drug transporters complicate understanding their complex relationships with ligands. To address this challenge, it is essential to gather and summarize information on drug transporters, inhibitors and substrates, and simultaneously develop a comprehensive and user-friendly database. Current online resources often provide fragmented information and have limited coverage of drug transporter substrates and inhibitors, highlighting the need for a specialized, comprehensive and openly accessible database. ISTransbase addresses this gap by amassing a substantial amount of data from literature, government documents and open databases. It includes 16 528 inhibitors and 4465 substrates of 163 drug transporters from 18 different species, resulting in a total of 93 841 inhibitor records and 51 053 substrate records. ISTransbase provides detailed insights into drug transporters and their inhibitors/substrates, encompassing transporter and molecule structure, transporter function and distribution, as well as experimental methods and results from transport or inhibition experiments. Furthermore, ISTransbase offers three search strategies that allow users to retrieve drugs and transporters based on multiple selectable constraints, as well as perform checks for drug-drug interactions. Users can also browse and download data. In summary, ISTransbase (https://istransbase.scbdd.com/) serves as a valuable resource for accurately and efficiently accessing information on drug transporter inhibitors and substrates, aiding researchers in exploring drug transporter mechanisms and assisting clinicians in mitigating adverse drug reactions\n\n Database URL: https://istransbase.scbdd.com/",

With the rapid development of high-throughput experimental technology in recent years, the number of datasets in the new release of DeOri 10.0 increased from 10 to 151 and the number of sequences increased from 16,145 to 9,742,396. Besides nucleotide sequences and browser extensible data (BED) files, corresponding annotation files, such as coding sequences (CDSs), mRNAs, and other biological elements within replication origins, are also provided. The experimental techniques used for each dataset, as well as related statistical data, are also presented on web page. Differences in experimental methods, cell lines, and sequencing technologies have resulted in distinct replication origins, making it challenging to differentiate between cell-specific and non-specific replication origins. Based on multiple replication origin datasets at the species level, we scored and screened replication origins in Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The screened regions with high scores were considered as species-conservative origins, which are integrated and presented as reference replication origins (rORIs). Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of relevant genomic elements associated with replication origins at the genome level, such as CpG island (CGI), transcription start site (TSS), and G-quadruplex (G4).

Computational optimization can effectively aid the design process, but current methods are generally unsuited for systems with multiple temporal or concentration scales, as these are slow to simulate due to their numerical stiffness. Here, we present a machine learning method for the efficient optimization of biological circuits across scales. The method relies on Bayesian optimization, a technique commonly used to fine-tune deep neural networks, to learn the shape of a performance landscape and iteratively navigate the design space toward an optimal circuit. This strategy allows the joint optimization of both circuit architecture and parameters, and provides a feasible approach to solve a highly nonconvex optimization problem in a mixed-integer input space. We illustrate the applicability of the method on several gene circuits for controlling biosynthetic pathways with strong nonlinearities, multiple interacting scales, and using various performance objectives. The method efficiently handles large multiscale problems and enables parametric sweeps to assess circuit robustness to perturbations, serving as an efficient in silico screening method prior to experimental implementation.",

With a constantly growing population and increased urbanization, this is only predicted to rise. Thus, achieving sustainable development in the construction sector has become an urgent necessity. The adoption of biomimicry in the construction sector is one of the most innovative concepts towards the shift into sustainable practices in construction. However, it has been noticed that the concept of biomimicry is very broad, relatively new, and abstract. Thus, after reviewing previously conducted research on the subject, a noticeable lack of knowledge on the effective implementation of the biomimicry concept was found to be present. Therefore, this research seeks to fill this knowledge gap whereby it aims to explore the development of the biomimicry concept in the field of architecture, building construction, and civil engineering with a systematic review approach of research related to biomimicry in these three fields. This aim is guided by an objective of developing a clear understanding of the application of the biomimicry concept in architecture, building construction, and civil engineering fields.

Since the first report in 1987 and characterization in 2007 as a bacterial defense mechanism, this system has garnered immense interest and research attention. CRISPR systems provide immunity to bacteria against invading genetic material; however, with specific modifications in sequence and structure, it becomes a precise editing system capable of modifying the genomes of a wide range of organisms. The refinement of these modifications encompasses diverse approaches, including the development of more accurate nucleases, understanding of the cellular context and epigenetic conditions, and the re-designing guide RNAs (gRNAs). Considering the critical importance of the correct performance of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, our scope will emphasize the latter approach. Hence, we present an overview of the past and the most recent guide RNA web-based design tools, highlighting the evolution of their computational architecture and gRNA characteristics over the years. Our study explains computational approaches that use machine learning techniques, neural networks, and gRNA/target interactions data to enable predictions and classifications.

It provides support for the full utilization of real world medical big data in clinical research and medical services for specific diseases.\n\nMethods\n\nThe development of DSCDS involved (1) requirements analysis on precision medicine, medical big data, and clinical research; (2) design schematics and basic architecture; (3) standard datasets of specific diseases consisting of common data elements (CDEs); (4) collection and aggregation of specific disease data scattered in various medical business systems of the hospital; (5) governance and quality improvement of specific disease data; (6) data storage and computing; and (7) design of data application modules.\n\nResults\n\nA DSCDS for liver cirrhosis was created in the gastrointestinal department of a 3A grade hospital in China and had more than nine data application modules. Based on this DSCDS, a series of clinical studies are being carried out, such as retrospective or prospective cohorts, prognostic studies using multimodal data, and follow-up studies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe development of the DSCDS for liver cirrhosis in this paper provides experience and reference for the design and development of DSCDSs for other specific diseases in China; it can even expand to the development of DSCDSs in other countries if they have the demand for DSCDS and the same or better medical informatization foundation. DSCDS has more accurate, standard, comprehensive, multimodal and usable data of specific diseases than the general clinical database system and clinical data repository (CDR) and provides a credible data foundation for medical research, clinical decision-making and improving the medical service quality of specific diseases.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13755-023-00211-4.",

      "title": " CC+ : A searchable database of validated coiled coils in PDB structures and AlphaFold2 models",
      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nalpha-Helical coiled coils are common tertiary and quaternary elements of protein structure. In coiled coils, two or more alpha helices wrap around each other to form bundles. This apparently simple structural motif can generate many architectures and topologies. Coiled coil-forming sequences can be predicted from heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues,  hpphppp , although this is not always reliable. Alternatively, coiled-coil structures can be identified using the program SOCKET, which finds knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing between side chains of neighboring helices. SOCKET also classifies coiled-coil architecture and topology, thus allowing sequence-to-structure relationships to be garnered. In 2009, we used SOCKET to create a relational database of coiled-coil structures, CC+, from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here, we report an update of CC+ following an update of SOCKET (to Socket2) and the recent explosion of structural data and the success of AlphaFold2 in predicting protein structures from genome sequences. With the most-stringent SOCKET parameters, CC+ contains  12,000 coiled-coil assemblies from experimentally determined structures, and  120,000 potential coiled-coil structures within single-chain models predicted by AlphaFold2 across 48 proteomes. CC+ allows these and other less-stringently defined coiled coils to be searched at various levels of structure, sequence, and side-chain interactions. The identified coiled coils can be viewed directly from CC+ using the Socket2 application, and their associated data can be downloaded for further analyses. CC+ is available freely at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/CCPlus/Home.html. It will be updated automatically. We envisage that CC+ could be used to understand coiled-coil assemblies and their sequence-to-structure relationships, and to aid protein design and engineering.",

Since 2005, the West Coast Metabolomics Center at the University of California at Davis has collated GC/MS metabolomics data from over 156,000 samples and 2000 studies into the standardized BinBase database. We believe that the observations from these samples will provide meaningful insight to biologists and that our data treatment and webtool will provide insight to others who seek to standardize disparate metabolomics studies. We here developed an easy-to-use query interface, BinDiscover, to enable intuitive, rapid hypothesis generation for biologists based on these metabolomic samples. BinDiscover creates observation summaries and graphics across a broad range of species, organs, diseases, and compounds. Throughout the components of BinDiscover, we emphasize the use of ontologies to aggregate large groups of samples based on the proximity of their metadata within these ontologies. This adjacency allows for the simultaneous exploration of entire categories such as \"rodents\", \"digestive tract\", or \"amino acids\". The ontologies are particularly relevant for BinDiscover's ontologically grouped differential analysis, which, like other components of BinDiscover, creates clear graphs and summary statistics across compounds and biological metadata.

      "abstract": "Modern investigations in biology often require the efforts of one or more groups of researchers. Often these are groups of specialists from various scientific fields who generate and share data of different formats and sizes. Without modern approaches to work automation and data versioning (where data from different collaborators are stored at different points in time), teamwork quickly devolves into unmanageable confusion. In this review, we present a number of information systems designed to solve these problems. Their application to the organization of scientific activity helps to manage the flow of actions and data, allowing all participants to work with relevant information and solving the issue of reproducibility of both experimental and computational results. The article describes methods for organizing data flows within a team, principles for organizing metadata and ontologies. The information systems Trello, Git, Redmine, SEEK, OpenBIS and Galaxy are considered. Their functionality and scope of use are described. Before using any tools, it is important to understand the purpose of implementation, to define the set of tasks they should solve, and, based on this, to formulate requirements and finally to monitor the application of recommendations in the field. The tasks of creating a framework of ontologies, metadata, data warehousing schemas and software systems are key for a team that has decided to undertake work to automate data circulation. It is not always possible to implement such systems in their entirety, but one should still strive to do so through a step-by-step introduction of principles for organizing data and tasks with the mastery of individual software tools. It is worth noting that Trello, Git, and Redmine are easier to use, customize, and support for small research groups. At the same time, SEEK, OpenBIS, and Galaxy are more specific and their use is advisable if the capabilities of simple systems are no longer sufficient.",

Here, we report on updates to the Planteome reference ontologies, namely, the Plant Ontology (PO), Trait Ontology (TO), the Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology (PECO), and integration of species/crop-specific vocabularies from our partners, the Crop Ontology (CO) into the TO ontology graph. Currently, 11 CO vocabularies are integrated into the Planteome with the addition of yam, sorghum, and potato since 2018. In addition, the size of the annotation database has increased by 34%, and the number of bioentities (genes, proteins, etc.) from 125 plant taxa has increased by 72%. We developed new tools to facilitate user requests and improvements to the CO vocabularies, and to allow fast searching and browsing of PO terms and definitions. These enhancements and future changes to automate the TO-CO mappings and knowledge discovery tools ensure that the Planteome will continue to be a valuable resource for plant biology.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

Modern proteomic techniques are excellent at producing a parts-list for such complexes, but more detailed analysis demands a network approach linking the molecules together and analysing the emergent architectural properties.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present an update to the ellipsoid profile algorithm (EP), a simple technique for the measurement of the globularity of protein structures without the calculation of molecular surfaces. The globularity property is understood in this context as the ability of the molecule to fill a minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid (MVEE) that approximates its assumed globular shape. The more of the interior of this ellipsoid is occupied by the atoms of the protein, the better are its globularity metrics. These metrics are derived from the comparison of the volume of the voxelized representation of the atoms and the volume of all voxels that can fit inside that ellipsoid (a uniform unit A cube lattice). The so-called ellipsoid profile shows how the globularity changes with the distance from the center. Two of its values, the so-called ellipsoid indexes, are used to classify the structure as globular, semi-globular or non-globular. Here, we enhance the workflow of the EP algorithm via an improved outlier detection subroutine based on principal component analysis. It is capable of robust distinguishing between the dense parts of the molecules and, for example, disordered chain fragments fully exposed to the solvent. The PCA-based method replaces the current approach based on kernel density estimation. The improved EP algorithm was tested on 2124 representatives of domain superfamilies from SCOP 2.08. The second part of this work is dedicated to the survey of globularity of 3594 representatives of biological assemblies from molecules currently deposited in the PDB and analyzed by the 3DComplex database (monomers and complexes up to 60 chains).",

It is widely used in essential fields such as industry, agriculture, animal husbandry and medicine. At the same time, LAB are closely related to human health. They can regulate human intestinal flora and improve gastrointestinal function and body immunity. Cancer, a disease in which some cells grow out of control and spread to other body parts, is one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. In recent years, the potential of LAB in cancer treatment has attracted attention. Mining knowledge from the scientific literature significantly accelerates its application in cancer treatment. Using 7794 literature studies of LAB cancer as source data, we have processed 16 543 biomedical concepts and 23 091 associations by using automatic text mining tools combined with manual curation of domain experts. An ontology containing 31 434 pieces of structured data is constructed. Finally, based on ontology, a knowledge graph (KG) database, which is called Beyond 'Lactic acid bacteria to Cancer Knowledge graph Database' (BLAB2CancerKD), is constructed by using KG and web technology. BLAB2CancerKD presents all the relevant knowledge intuitively and clearly in various data presentation forms, and the interactive system function also makes it more efficient.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nMetaproteomics, a method for untargeted, high-throughput identification of proteins in complex samples, provides functional information about microbial communities and can tie functions to specific taxa. Metaproteomics often generates less data than other omics techniques, but analytical workflows can be improved to increase usable data in metaproteomic outputs. Identification of peptides in the metaproteomic analysis is performed by comparing mass spectra of sample peptides to a reference database of protein sequences. Although these protein databases are an integral part of the metaproteomic analysis, few studies have explored how database composition impacts peptide identification. Here, we used cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from a study of bacterial vaginosis (BV) to compare the performance of databases built using six different strategies. We evaluated broad versus sample-matched databases, as well as databases populated with proteins translated from metagenomic sequencing of the same samples versus sequences from public repositories. Smaller sample-matched databases performed significantly better, driven by the statistical constraints on large databases. Additionally, large databases attributed up to 34% of significant bacterial hits to taxa absent from the sample, as determined orthogonally by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We also tested a set of hybrid databases which included bacterial proteins from NCBI RefSeq and translated bacterial genes from the samples. These hybrid databases had the best overall performance, identifying 1,068 unique human and 1,418 unique bacterial proteins, ~30% more than a database populated with proteins from typical vaginal bacteria and fungi. Our findings can help guide the optimal identification of proteins while maintaining statistical power for reaching biological conclusions.\n\nIMPORTANCE\n\nMetaproteomic analysis can provide valuable insights into the functions of microbial and cellular communities by identifying a broad, untargeted set of proteins. The databases used in the analysis of metaproteomic data influence results by defining what proteins can be identified. Moreover, the size of the database impacts the number of identifications after accounting for false discovery rates (FDRs). Few studies have tested the performance of different strategies for building a protein database to identify proteins from metaproteomic data and those that have largely focused on highly diverse microbial communities. We tested a range of databases on CVL samples and found that a hybrid sample-matched approach, using publicly available proteins from organisms present in the samples, as well as proteins translated from metagenomic sequencing of the samples, had the best performance. However, our results also suggest that public sequence databases will continue to improve as more bacterial genomes are published.",

The ability to site-specifically incorporate biologically relevant non-standard amino acids using orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) has proven particularly useful, providing unparalleled access to cellular mechanisms modulated by post-translational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation. However, despite significant advances in OTS design and function, the systems-level biology of OTS development and utilization remains underexplored. In this study, we employ a phosphoserine OTS (pSerOTS) as a model to systematically investigate global interactions between OTS components and the cellular environment, aiming to improve OTS performance. Based on this analysis, we design OTS variants to enhance orthogonality by minimizing host process interactions and reducing stress response activation. Our findings advance understanding of system-wide OTS:host interactions, enabling informed design practices that circumvent deleterious interactions with host physiology while improving OTS performance and stability. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of establishing a pipeline for systematically profiling OTS:host interactions to enhance orthogonality and mitigate mechanisms underlying OTS-mediated host toxicity.\n\nAnalyses of global interactions between orthogonal translation systems (OTS) and the cellular environment, enable informed design practices that improve OTS performance by minimizing OTS:host interactions that reduce biological tolerance.

      "title": "Towards Automated Optimization of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks for Electrocardiogram Classification",
      "abstract": "The interpretation of biological data such as the ElectroCardioGram (ECG) signal gives clinical information and helps to assess the heart function. There are distinct ECG patterns associated with a specific class of arrhythmia. The convolutional neural network, inspired by findings in the study of biological vision, is currently one of the most commonly employed deep neural network algorithms for ECG processing. However, deep neural network models require many hyperparameters to tune. Selecting the optimal or the best hyperparameter for the convolutional neural network algorithm is a highly challenging task. Often, we end up tuning the model manually with different possible ranges of values until a best fit model is obtained. Automatic hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian Optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms can provide an effective solution to current labour-intensive manual configuration approaches. In this paper, we propose to optimize the Residual one Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model (R-1D-CNN) at two levels. At the first level, a residual convolutional layer and one-dimensional convolutional neural layers are trained to learn patient-specific ECG features over which multilayer perceptron layers can learn to produce the final class vectors of each input. This level is manual and aims to limit the search space and select the most important hyperparameters to optimize. The second level is automatic and based on our proposed BO-based algorithm. Our optimized proposed architecture (BO-R-1D-CNN) is evaluated on two publicly available ECG datasets. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our BO-based algorithm achieves an optimal rate of 99.95% for the MIT-BIH database to discriminate between five kinds of heartbeats, including normal heartbeats, left bundle branch block, atrial premature, right bundle branch block, and premature ventricular contraction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture fine-tuned with BO achieves a higher accuracy tested on the 10,000 ECG patients dataset compared to the other proposed architectures. Our optimized architecture achieves excellent results compared to previous works on the two benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nWith the continuous upgrading of high-throughput sequencing technology, a large amount of biological genome data has been deciphered and published. The research on functional genes of biological genomes urgently needs a collection of service websites with user-friendly and full annotation functions for a variety of gene function annotation tools. In this study, iCAZyGFADB, which is a database website integrating nine gene function annotation tools, was perfectly developed to meet the needs of biological genome functional annotation. Its nine gene function annotation tools were Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZyme) annotation, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation, Cluster of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotation, Evolutionary Genealogy of Genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggNOG) annotation, SwissProt annotation, Pfam annotation, KOG annotation and Animal Transcription Factor DataBase (AnimalTFDB) annotation. It has three advantages. First, it is superior to gene function annotation of other biological cloud analysis platforms and runs very fast. Second, all gene annotation functions of the website are free and open to users. Third, it can annotate eight gene functions (GO, KEGG, COG, eggNOG, SwissProt, Pfam, KOG and AnimalTFDB annotation) of a single species at the same time, while other cloud platforms do not have the ability or need to charge to open for users to complete the annotation of eight gene functions at the same time. Moreover, the development and operation of our database will provide great help for gene function annotation research and significantly improve the efficiency of genome function research and reduce the cost of bioinformatics analysis. Genomic functional annotation researchers can access this database through the following website: http://www.icazygfadb.org.cn/.\n\n Database URL:  http://www.icazygfadb.org.cn/",

      "title": "The importance of graph databases and graph learning for clinical applications",
      "abstract": "Abstract\n\n The increasing amount and complexity of clinical data require an appropriate way of storing and analyzing those data. Traditional approaches use a tabular structure (relational databases) for storing data and thereby complicate storing and retrieving interlinked data from the clinical domain. Graph databases provide a great solution for this by storing data in a graph as nodes (vertices) that are connected by edges (links). The underlying graph structure can be used for the subsequent data analysis (graph learning). Graph learning consists of two parts: graph representation learning and graph analytics. Graph representation learning aims to reduce high-dimensional input graphs to low-dimensional representations. Then, graph analytics uses the obtained representations for analytical tasks like visualization, classification, link prediction and clustering which can be used to solve domain-specific problems. In this survey, we review current state-of-the-art graph database management systems, graph learning algorithms and a variety of graph applications in the clinical domain. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive use case for a clearer understanding of complex graph learning algorithms.\n\n Graphical abstract  ",

However, a notable disparity exists between its remarkable development and the need for standardization to facilitate seamless interoperability among systems. The field is thus impeded by an overwhelming proliferation of organism-specific systems that frequently lack compatibility. To overcome these issues, we present Golden Standard (GS), a Type IIS assembly method underpinned by the Standard European Vector Architecture. GS unlocks modular cloning applications for most bacteria, and delivers combinatorial multi-part assembly to create genetic circuits of up to twenty transcription units (TUs). Reliance on MoClo syntax renders GS fully compatible with many existing tools and it sets the path towards efficient reusability of available part libraries and assembled TUs. GS was validated in terms of DNA assembly, portability, interoperability and phenotype engineering in alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-proteobacteria. Furthermore, we provide a computational pipeline for parts characterization that was used to assess the performance of GS parts. To promote community-driven development of GS, we provide a dedicated web-portal including a repository of parts, vectors, and Wizard and Setup tools that guide users in designing constructs. Overall, GS establishes an open, standardized framework propelling the progress of synthetic biology as a whole.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "A vaccine is defined as a biologic preparation that trains the immune system, boosts immunity, and protects against a deadly microbial infection. They have been used for centuries to combat a variety of contagious illnesses by means of subsiding the disease burden as well as eradicating the disease. Since infectious disease pandemics are a recurring global threat, vaccination has emerged as one of the most promising tools to save millions of lives and reduce infection rates. The World Health Organization reports that immunization protects three million individuals annually. Currently, multi-epitope-based peptide vaccines are a unique concept in vaccine formulation. Epitope-based peptide vaccines utilize small fragments of proteins or peptides (parts of the pathogen), called epitopes, that trigger an adequate immune response against a particular pathogen. However, conventional vaccine designing and development techniques are too cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. With the recent advancement in bioinformatics, immunoinformatics, and vaccinomics discipline, vaccine science has entered a new era accompanying a modern, impressive, and more realistic paradigm in designing and developing next-generation strong immunogens. In silico designing and developing a safe and novel vaccine construct involves knowledge of reverse vaccinology, various vaccine databases, and high throughput techniques. The computational tools and techniques directly associated with vaccine research are extremely effective, economical, precise, robust, and safe for human use. Many vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials instantly and are available prior to schedule. In light of this, the present article provides researchers with up-to-date information on various approaches, protocols, and databases regarding the computational designing and development of potent multi-epitope-based peptide vaccines that can assist researchers in tailoring vaccines more rapidly and cost-effectively.",

The severity of this adverse scenario presents unprecedented challenges to human health, water supply, agriculture, forestry, ecological systems, and biodiversity, among other areas.

      "abstract": "Background\n\nComputational models of cell signaling networks are extremely useful tools for the exploration of underlying system behavior and prediction of response to various perturbations. By representing signaling cascades as executable Boolean networks, the previously developed rxncon (\"reaction-contingency\") formalism and associated Python package enable accurate and scalable modeling of signal transduction even in large (thousands of components) biological systems. The models are split into reactions, which generate states, and contingencies, that impinge on reactions; this avoids the so-called \"combinatorial explosion\" of system size. Boolean description of the biological system compensates for the poor availability of kinetic parameters which are necessary for quantitative models. Unfortunately, few tools are available to support rxncon model development, especially for large, intricate systems. \n\nResults\n\nWe present the kboolnet toolkit (https://github.com/Kufalab-UCSD/kboolnet, complete documentation at https://github.com/Kufalab-UCSD/kboolnet/wiki), an R package and a set of scripts that seamlessly integrate with the python-based rxncon software and collectively provide a complete workflow for the verification, validation, and visualization of rxncon models. The verification script VerifyModel.R checks for responsiveness to repeated stimulations as well as consistency of steady state behavior. The validation scripts TruthTable.R, SensitivityAnalysis.R, and ScoreNet.R provide various readouts for the comparison of model predictions to experimental data. In particular, ScoreNet.R compares model predictions to a cloud-stored MIDAS-format experimental database to provide a numerical score for tracking model accuracy. Finally, the visualization scripts allow for graphical representations of model topology and behavior. The entire kboolnet toolkit is cloud-enabled, allowing for easy collaborative development; most scripts also allow for the extraction and analysis of individual user-defined \"modules\".\n\nConclusion\n\nThe kboolnet toolkit provides a modular, cloud-enabled workflow for the development of rxncon models, as well as their verification, validation, and visualization. This will enable the creation of larger, more comprehensive, and more rigorous models of cell signaling using the rxncon formalism in the future.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12859-023-05329-6.",

However, there is a lack of predictive models for overall survival (OS) and disease -specific survival (DSS) in AC. This study aimed to develop a prognostic nomogram for patients with AC using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database.\n\nMethods\n\nData from 891 patients between 2004 and 2019 were downloaded and extracted from the SEER database. They were randomly divided into the development group (70%) and the verification group (30%), and then univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, respectively, was used to explore the possible risk factors of AC. The factors significantly related to OS and DSS were used to establish the nomogram, which was assessed via the concordance index (C-index), and calibration curve. An internal validation was conducted to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the nomogram. Kaplan-Meier calculation was used to predict the further OS and DSS status of these patients.\n\nResults\n\nOn multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, the independent prognostic risk factors associated with OS were age, surgery, chemotherapy, regional node positive (RNP),extension range and distant metastasis with a moderate C-index of 0.731 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.719-0.744) and 0.766 (95% CI: 0.747-0.785) in the development and verification groups, respectively. While, marital status, surgery, chemotherapy, regional node positive (RNP),extension range and distant metastasis were significantly linked to AC patients' DSS, which have a better C-index of 0.756 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.741-0.770) and 0.781 (95% CI: 0.757-0.805) in the development and verification groups.

      "abstract": "With developments in synthetic biology, \"engineering biology\" has emerged through standardization and platformization based on hierarchical, orthogonal, and modularized biological systems. Genome engineering is necessary to manufacture and design synthetic cells with desired functions by using bioparts obtained from sequence databases. Among various tools, the CRISPR-Cas system is modularly composed of guide RNA and Cas nuclease; therefore, it is convenient for editing the genome freely. Recently, various strategies have been developed to accurately edit the genome at a single nucleotide level. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas technology has been extended to molecular diagnostics for nucleic acids and detection of pathogens, including disease-causing viruses. Moreover, CRISPR technology, which can precisely control the expression of specific genes in cells, is evolving to find the target of metabolic biotechnology. In this review, we summarize the status of various CRISPR technologies that can be applied to synthetic biology and discuss the development of synthetic biology combined with CRISPR technology in microbiology.

      "title": "A comparison of approaches to accessing existing biological and chemical relational databases via SPARQL",
      "abstract": "Current biological and chemical research is increasingly dependent on the reusability of previously acquired data, which typically come from various sources. Consequently, there is a growing need for database systems and databases stored in them to be interoperable with each other. One of the possible solutions to address this issue is to use systems based on Semantic Web technologies, namely on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to express data and on the SPARQL query language to retrieve the data. Many existing biological and chemical databases are stored in the form of a relational database (RDB). Converting a relational database into the RDF form and storing it in a native RDF database system may not be desirable in many cases. It may be necessary to preserve the original database form, and having two versions of the same data may not be convenient. A solution may be to use a system mapping the relational database to the RDF form. Such a system keeps data in their original relational form and translates incoming SPARQL queries to equivalent SQL queries, which are evaluated by a relational-database system. This review compares different RDB-to-RDF mapping systems with a primary focus on those that can be used free of charge. In addition, it compares different approaches to expressing RDB-to-RDF mappings. The review shows that these systems represent a viable method providing sufficient performance. Their real-life performance is demonstrated on data and queries coming from the neXtProt project.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13321-023-00729-5.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nWith the perspicuous effect of COVID-19 on vaccine demand, academic and business interest in vaccine production in the BRICS nations (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) has reached a crescendo. Aware of a \"dark\" past when the BRICS depended heavily on vaccines and pharmaceuticals from other parts of the world, academic curiosity on how the BRICS countries have leveraged vaccine self-sufficiency and become the hub of global vaccine production and supply is justifiable, especially in times of ineffable pandemics.\n\nMethods\n\nThe articles were searched from November 2020 to December 2022. Within this period, an electronic search of 13 reputable healthcare and public databases was conducted. The initial searches from the designated databases yielded a total of 3,928 articles. Then, duplicated studies were removed through a two-step process, articles without titles and abstracts were excluded, and the remaining 898 articles that met the qualification assessment criteria were evaluated for article quality.\n\nResults\n\nThe main entrepreneurial innovations that have quickened the pace of vaccine self-sufficiency in the BRICS include investment in artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics, and Blockchain technologies. These help to speed up the drug delivery process by enhancing patient identification or optimizing potential drug candidates for clinical trials and production.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past 20 years, the BRICS nations have achieved major strides in vaccine development, regulation, and production. The creation of the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development (R&D) Center will have a significant impact on vaccine cost and accessibility given the anticipated development of stronger research capability, production, and distribution technology, as well as stronger standardization to improve vaccine production quality in the near future. It is anticipated that the BRICS' contributions to vaccine development will alter the global vaccination market and hasten the availability of vaccinations in developing nations. The challenge is turning these hopes into concrete plans of action and outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThere is an urgent need for high-quality biodiversity data in the context of rapid environmental change. Nowhere is this need more urgent than in the deep ocean, with the possibility of seabed mining moving from exploration to exploitation, but where vast knowledge gaps persist. Regions of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction, managed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), are undergoing intensive mining exploration, including the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Central Pacific. In 2019, the ISA launched its database 'DeepData', publishing environmental (including biological) data. Here, we explore how DeepData could support biological research and environmental policy development in the CCZ (and wider ocean regions) and whether data are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Given the direct connection of DeepData with the regulator of a rapidly developing potential industry, this review is particularly timely. We found evidence of extensive duplication of datasets; an absence of unique record identifiers and significant taxonomic data-quality issues, compromising FAIRness of the data. The publication of DeepData records on the OBIS ISA node in 2021 has led to large-scale improvements in data quality and accessibility. However, limitations in the usage of identifiers and issues with taxonomic information were also evident in datasets published on the node, stemming from mismapping of data from the ISA environmental data template to the data standard Darwin Core prior to data harvesting by OBIS. While notable data-quality issues remain, these changes signal a rapid evolution for the database and significant movement towards integrating with global systems, through the usage of data standards and publication on the global data aggregator OBIS. This is exactly what has been needed for biological datasets held by the ISA. We provide recommendations for the future development of the database to support this evolution towards FAIR.\n\n Database URL https://data.isa.org.jm/isa/map ",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nHigh-throughput clonal tracking in patients under hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy with integrating vector is instrumental in assessing bio-safety and efficacy. Monitoring the fate of millions of transplanted clones and their progeny across differentiation and proliferation over time leverages the identification of the vector integration sites, used as surrogates of clonal identity. Although gamma-tracking retroviral insertion sites (gamma-TRIS) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for clonal identification, the computational drawbacks in the tracking algorithm, based on a combinatorial all-versus-all strategy, limit its use in clinical studies with several thousands of samples per patient. We developed the first clonal tracking graph database, InCliniGene (https://github.com/calabrialab/InCliniGene), that imports the output files of gamma-TRIS and generates the graph of clones (nodes) connected by arches if two nodes share common genomic features as defined by the gamma-TRIS rules. Embedding both clonal data and their connections in the graph, InCliniGene can track all clones longitudinally over samples through data queries that fully explore the graph. This approach resulted in being highly accurate and scalable. We validated InCliniGene using an in vitro dataset, specifically designed to mimic clinical cases, and tested the accuracy and precision. InCliniGene allows extensive use of gamma-TRIS in large gene therapy clinical applications and naturally realizes the full data integration of molecular and genomics data, clinical and treatment measurements and genomic annotations. Further extensions of InCliniGene with data federation and with application programming interface will support data mining toward precision, personalized and predictive medicine in gene therapy.\n\n Database URL:  https://github.com/calabrialab/InCliniGene",

Centenarians, exemplifying extreme longevity, serve as models for healthy aging. The field of human aging and longevity research is rapidly advancing, garnering significant attention and accumulating substantial data in recent years. Omics technologies, encompassing phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomics, have provided multidimensional insights and revolutionized cohort-based investigations into human aging and longevity. Accumulated data, covering diverse cells, tissues and cohorts across the lifespan necessitates the establishment of an open and integrated database. Addressing this, we established the Human Aging and Longevity Landscape (HALL), a comprehensive multi-omics repository encompassing a diverse spectrum of human cohorts, spanning from young adults to centenarians. The core objective of HALL is to foster healthy aging by offering an extensive repository of information on biomarkers that gauge the trajectory of human aging. Moreover, the database facilitates the development of diagnostic tools for aging-related conditions and empowers targeted interventions to enhance longevity.

With its ease of genetic manipulation and growth, supported by in-depth functional annotations in the PomBase database and genome-wide metabolic models,S. pombe is an attractive option for synthetic biology applications. However,S. pombe currently lacks modular tools for generating genetic circuits with more than 1 transcriptional unit. We developed a toolkit to address this gap. Adapted from the MoClo-YTK plasmid kit for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and using the same modular cloning grammar, our POMBOX toolkit is designed to facilitate fast, efficient, and modular construction of genetic circuits inS. pombe. It allows for interoperability when working with DNA sequences that are functional in bothS. cerevisiae and S. pombe (e.g., protein tags, antibiotic resistance cassettes, and coding sequences). Moreover, POMBOX enables the modular assembly of multigene pathways and increases the possible pathway length from 6 to 12 transcriptional units. We also adapted the stable integration vector homology arms to Golden Gate assembly and tested the genomic integration success rates depending on different sequence sizes, from 4 to 24 kb. We included 14 S. pombe promoters that we characterized using two fluorescent proteins, in both minimally defined (EMM2:Edinburgh minimal media) and complex (YES:yeast extract with supplements) media. Then, we examined the efficacy of 6 S. cerevisiae and 6 synthetic terminators in S. pombe. Finally, we used the POMBOX kit for a synthetic biology application in metabolic engineering and expressed plant enzymes in S. pombe to produce specialized metabolite precursors, namely, methylxanthine, amorpha-4,11-diene, and cinnamic acid from the purine, mevalonate, and aromatic amino acid pathways.",

In this Perspective, we analyze several data curation and sharing initiatives that have seen success in chemistry and molecular biology. We discuss several factors that have contributed to their success and how we can take lessons from these case studies and apply them to reaction data.

Benchmarking can also be important for community building and advancing methods in a principled way. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent single-cell benchmarks to summarize the scope, extensibility, and neutrality, as well as technical features and whether best practices in open data and reproducible research were followed. The results highlight that while benchmarks often make code available and are in principle reproducible, they remain difficult to extend, for example, as new methods and new ways to assess methods emerge. In addition, embracing containerization and workflow systems would enhance reusability of intermediate benchmarking results, thus also driving wider adoption.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-023-02962-5.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nBackground\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly complex and heterogeneous disorder. Abnormal brain connectivity in ADHD might be influenced by developmental ages which might lead to the lacking of significant spatial convergence across studies. However, the developmental patterns and mechanisms of ADHD brain connectivity remain to be fully uncovered.\n\nMethods\n\nIn the present study, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase for seed-based whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity studies of ADHD published through October 12th, 2020. The seeds meeting inclusion criteria were categorized into the cortex group and subcortex group, as previous studies suggested that the cortex and subcortex have different temporal patterns of development. Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was performed to investigate the abnormal connectivity in different age groups (all-age group, younger: <12 years, older: >=12 years). Moreover, significant convergence of reported foci was used as seeds for validation with our independent dataset.\n\nResults\n\nAs with previous studies, scarce results were found in the all-age group. However, we found that the younger group consistently exhibited hyper-connectivity between different parts of the cortex and left middle frontal gyrus, and hypo-connectivity between different parts of the cortex and left putamen/pallidus/amygdala. Whereas, the older group (mainly for adults) showed hyper-connectivity between the cortex and right precuneus/sub-gyral/cingulate gyrus. Besides, the abnormal cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical functional connectivity in children, and the abnormal cortico-cortical functional connectivity in adults were verified in our independent dataset.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study emphasizes the importance of developmental age effects on the study of brain networks in ADHD. Further, we proposed that cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connectivity might play an important role in the pathophysiology of children with ADHD, while abnormal cortico-cortical connections were more important for adults with ADHD. This work provided a potential new insight to understand the neurodevelopmental mechanisms and possible clinical application of ADHD.\n\nAbnormal brain connectivity in ADHD might be influenced by developmental ages which might lead to the lacking of significant spatial convergence across studies. Cortico-cortical and cortical-subcortical connectivity might be an essential aspect in the pathophysiology of children with ADHD, while abnormal cortico-cortical connections were more important for older ADHD (mainly for adults with ADHD).

      "abstract": "The present study explicitly evaluated the genetic structure of Aedes aegypti Linn, the vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, across different geo-climatic zones of India and also elucidated the impact of ecological and topographic factors. After data quality checks and removal of samples with excess null alleles, the final analysis was performed on 589 individual samples using 10 microsatellite markers. Overall findings of this study suggested that, Ae. aegypti populations are highly diverse with moderate genetic differentiation between them. Around half of the populations (13 out of 22) formed two genetic clusters roughly associated with geographical regions. The remaining nine populations shared genetic ancestries with either one or both of the clusters. A significant relationship between genetic and geographic distance was observed, indicating isolation by distance. However, spatial autocorrelation analysis predicted the signs of long-distance admixture. Post-hoc environmental association analysis showed that 52.7% of genetic variations were explained by a combination of climatic and topographic factors, with latitude and temperature being the best predictors. This study indicated that though overall genetic differentiation among Ae. aegypti populations across India is moderate (Fst = 0.099), the differences between the populations are developing due to the factors associated with geographic locations. This study improves the understanding of the Ae. aegypti population structure in India that may assist in predicting mosquito movements across the geo-climatic zones, enabling effective control strategies and assessing the risk of disease transmission.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nAedes aegypti is a mosquito species that transmits several arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, etc. This species was originally found in Africa but is now extensive in all the continents except Antarctica. The spread of this species is of concern as the movement of infected mosquitoes can spread the viruses from one place to another. Anthropogenic changes such as climate warming and increasing urbanization are boosting the spread. This study focuses on analyzing the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in India and how it is affected by the local topological and climatic factors. We analyzed Ae. aegypti populations from different geographical regions in India covering the parts from North to South and East to West and analyzed them using a panel of microsatellite markers. Our analysis suggested that Ae. aegypti populations in India are genetically closer to each other irrespective of geographical distance between them which indicates high gene flow among the populations. However, signs of genetic structure were also observed owing to the factors associated with geographical locations. This research provides a broader picture of the nature and dynamics of the mosquito populations among eco-geographical regions across a larger area of the country, which would provide a valuable reference base for genetic studies and for novel mosquito control strategies.",

      "title": "Medical Image Retrieval via Nearest Neighbor Search on Pre-trained Image Features",
      "abstract": "Nearest neighbor search, also known as NNS, is a technique used to locate the points in a high-dimensional space closest to a given query point. This technique has multiple applications in medicine, such as searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, and diagnosis. However, when the number of points is significantly large, the brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible. Therefore, various approaches have been developed to make the search faster and more efficient to support the applications. With a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes DenseLinkSearch (DLS), an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a medical database, the proposed algorithm builds an index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. We also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer-based approaches on benchmark medical image retrieval datasets. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing approaches in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. In comparison to the existing approximate NNS approaches, our proposed DLS approach outperformed them in terms of lower average time per query and >= 99%  on 11 out of 13 benchmark datasets. We also found that the proposed medical feature representation approach is better for representing medical images compared to the existing pre-trained image models. The proposed feature extraction strategy obtained an improvement of 9.37%, 7.0%, and 13.33% in terms of P@5, P@10, and P@20, respectively, in comparison to the best-performing pre-trained image model.

Despite the vast number of P450 genes available in databases (over 300,000), only a small fraction of them (less than 0.2 %) have undergone functional characterization.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo provide a convenient platform with abundant information on P450s and their corresponding reactions, we introduce the P450Rdb database, a manually curated resource compiles literature-supported reactions catalyzed by P450s.\n\nMethods\n\nAll the P450s and Reactions were manually curated from the literature and known databases. Subsequently, the P450 reactions organized and categorized according to their chemical reaction type and site. The website was developed using HTML and PHP languages, with the MySQL server utilized for data storage.\n\nResults\n\nThe current version of P450Rdb catalogs over 1,600 reactions, involving more than 590 P450s across a diverse range of over 200 species. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly interface with comprehensive information, enabling easy querying, browsing, and analysis of P450s and their corresponding reactions. P450Rdb is free available at http://www.cellknowledge.com.cn/p450rdb/.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe believe that this database will significantly promote structural and functional research on P450s, thereby fostering advancements in the fields of natural product synthesis, pharmaceutical engineering, biotechnological applications, agricultural and crop improvement, and the chemical industry.",

      "title": "Mslar: Microbial synthetic lethal and rescue database",
      "abstract": "Synthetic lethality (SL) occurs when mutations in two genes together lead to cell or organism death, while a single mutation in either gene does not have a significant impact. This concept can also be extended to three or more genes for SL. Computational and experimental methods have been developed to predict and verify SL gene pairs, especially for yeast and Escherichia coli. However, there is currently a lack of a specialized platform to collect microbial SL gene pairs. Therefore, we designed a synthetic interaction database for microbial genetics that collects 13,313 SL and 2,994 Synthetic Rescue (SR) gene pairs that are reported in the literature, as well as 86,981 putative SL pairs got through homologous transfer method in 281 bacterial genomes. Our database website provides multiple functions such as search, browse, visualization, and Blast. Based on the SL interaction data in the S. cerevisiae, we review the issue of duplications' essentiality and observed that the duplicated genes and singletons have a similar ratio of being essential when we consider both individual and SL. The Microbial Synthetic Lethal and Rescue Database (Mslar) is expected to be a useful reference resource for researchers interested in the SL and SR genes of microorganisms. Mslar is open freely to everyone and available on the web at http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/Mslar/.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nResearch on SL interaction could provide novel drug targets and help construct a minimal genome. There have been many studies using metabolic models of different microbial systems or experimental array screen to study SL interactions. Here we developed a database to collect SL gene pairs of microorganisms, while also including SR gene pairs. Studies have transferred SL gene pairs onto other species through lineal homology, and also found that there are SL interactions. Based on this principle, we also used Escherichia coli as a reference set to calculate potential SL interactions among more than 2,700 bacteria, among which 281 have homologous SL gene pairs verified in E. coli.",

      "abstract": "New tools and software in systems biology require testing and validation on reaction networks with desired characteristics such as number of reactions or oscillating behaviors. Often, there is only a modest number of published models that are suitable, so researchers must generate reaction networks with the desired characteristics, a process that can be computationally expensive. To reduce these computational costs, we developed a data base of synthetic reaction networks to facilitate reuse. The current database contains thousands of networks generated using directed evolution. The network are of two types: (1) those with oscillations in species concentrations and (2) those for which no oscillation was found using directed evolution. To facilitate access to networks of interest, the database is queryable by the number of species and reactants, the presence or absence of autocatalytic and degradation reactions, and the network behavior. Our analysis of the data revealed some interesting insights, such as the population of oscillating networks possess more autocatalytic reactions compared to random control networks. In the future, this database will be expanded to include other network behaviors.",

However, limited structural knowledge of its proteome has prevented a deeper understanding of yeast functionalities, interactions, and aggregation.\n\nResults\n\nIn this study, we introduce the A3D yeast database (A3DyDB), which offers an extensive catalog of aggregation propensity predictions for the S. cerevisiae proteome. We used Aggrescan 3D (A3D) and the newly released protein models from AlphaFold2 (AF2) to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for 6039 yeast proteins. The A3D algorithm exploits the information from 3D protein structures to calculate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. To facilitate simple and intuitive data analysis, A3DyDB provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing information on aggregation predictions from yeast protein structures. The A3DyDB also allows for the evaluation of the influence of natural or engineered mutations on protein stability and solubility. The A3DyDB is freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/yeast.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe A3DyDB addresses a gap in yeast resources by facilitating the exploration of correlations between structural aggregation propensity and diverse protein properties at the proteome level.

Identifying the potential toxicity in the early stage of compound/drug discovery is critical. The rapid development of computational methods for evaluating various toxicity categories has increased the need for comprehensive and system-level collection of toxicological data, associated attributes, and benchmarks. To contribute toward this goal, we proposed TOXRIC (https://toxric.bioinforai.tech/), a database with comprehensive toxicological data, standardized attribute data, practical benchmarks, informative visualization of molecular representations, and an intuitive function interface. The data stored in TOXRIC contains 113 372 compounds, 13 toxicity categories, 1474 toxicity endpoints covering in vivo/in vitro endpoints and 39 feature types, covering structural, target, transcriptome, metabolic data, and other descriptors. All the curated datasets of endpoints and features can be retrieved, downloaded and directly used as output or input to Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models. In addition to serving as a data repository, TOXRIC also provides visualization of benchmarks and molecular representations for all endpoint datasets. Based on these results, researchers can better understand and select optimal feature types, molecular representations, and baseline algorithms for each endpoint prediction task. We believe that the rich information on compound toxicology, ML-ready datasets, benchmarks and molecular representation distribution can greatly facilitate toxicological investigations, interpretation of toxicological mechanisms, compound/drug discovery and the development of computational methods.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nFive core functions of TOXRIC: comprehensive toxicological data, standardized feature data, practical benchmarks, informative visualization of molecular representations, and an intuitive function interface.",

Personalized nutrition aims to solve this problem by adapting dietary and lifestyle guidelines to the unique circumstances of each individual.

However, there are still major challenges to overcome, including the need for more robust data and standardization of methodologies for better subject monitoring and assessment. Here, we present the AI4Food database (AI4FoodDB), which gathers data from a nutritional weight loss intervention monitoring 100 overweight and obese participants during 1 month. Data acquisition involved manual traditional approaches, novel digital methods and the collection of biological samples, obtaining: (i) biological samples at the beginning and the end of the intervention, (ii) anthropometric measurements every 2 weeks, (iii) lifestyle and nutritional questionnaires at two different time points and (iv) continuous digital measurements for 2 weeks.

      "title": "Observer-study-based approaches to quantitatively evaluate the realism of synthetic medical images",
      "abstract": "Abstract\n\n Objective. Synthetic images generated by simulation studies have a well-recognized role in developing and evaluating imaging systems and methods. However, for clinically relevant development and evaluation, the synthetic images must be clinically realistic and, ideally, have the same distribution as that of clinical images. Thus, mechanisms that can quantitatively evaluate this clinical realism and, ideally, the similarity in distributions of the real and synthetic images, are much needed. Approach. We investigated two observer-study-based approaches to quantitatively evaluate the clinical realism of synthetic images. In the first approach, we presented a theoretical formalism for the use of an ideal-observer study to quantitatively evaluate the similarity in distributions between the real and synthetic images. This theoretical formalism provides a direct relationship between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC, for an ideal observer and the distributions of real and synthetic images. The second approach is based on the use of expert-human-observer studies to quantitatively evaluate the realism of synthetic images. In this approach, we developed a web-based software to conduct two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) experiments with expert human observers. The usability of this software was evaluated by conducting a system usability scale (SUS) survey with seven expert human readers and five observer-study designers. Further, we demonstrated the application of this software to evaluate a stochastic and physics-based image-synthesis technique for oncologic positron emission tomography (PET). In this evaluation, the 2-AFC study with our software was performed by six expert human readers, who were highly experienced in reading PET scans, with years of expertise ranging from 7 to 40 years (median: 12 years, average: 20.4 years). Main results. In the ideal-observer-study-based approach, we theoretically demonstrated that the AUC for an ideal observer can be expressed, to an excellent approximation, by the Bhattacharyya distance between the distributions of the real and synthetic images. This relationship shows that a decrease in the ideal-observer AUC indicates a decrease in the distance between the two image distributions. Moreover, a lower bound of ideal-observer AUC = 0.5 implies that the distributions of synthetic and real images exactly match. For the expert-human-observer-study-based approach, our software for performing the 2-AFC experiments is available at https://apps.mir.wustl.edu/twoafc. Results from the SUS survey demonstrate that the web application is very user friendly and accessible. As a secondary finding, evaluation of a stochastic and physics-based PET image-synthesis technique using our software showed that expert human readers had limited ability to distinguish the real images from the synthetic images. Significance. This work addresses the important need for mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate the clinical realism of synthetic images. The mathematical treatment in this paper shows that quantifying the similarity in the distribution of real and synthetic images is theoretically possible by using an ideal-observer-study-based approach. Our developed software provides a platform for designing and performing 2-AFC experiments with human observers in a highly accessible, efficient, and secure manner. Additionally, our results on the evaluation of the stochastic and physics-based image-synthesis technique motivate the application of this technique to develop and evaluate a wide array of PET imaging methods.",

Paleogenomics can also reveal historic and prehistoric agents of disease, including endemic, epidemic, and pandemic pathogens. Viruses:and in particular those with single- or double-stranded DNA genomes:are an important part of the paleogenomic revolution, preserving within some remains or environmental samples for tens of thousands of years. The results of these studies capture the public imagination, as well as giving scientists a unique perspective on some of the more slowly evolving viruses which cause disease. In this review, we revisit the first studies of historical virus genetic material in the 1990s, through to the genomic revolution of recent years. We look at how paleogenomics works for viral pathogens, such as the need for careful precautions against modern contamination and robust computational pipelines to identify and analyze authenticated viral sequences. We discuss the insights into virus evolution which have been gained through paleogenomics, concentrating on three DNA viruses in particular: parvovirus B19, herpes simplex virus 1, and smallpox. As we consider recent worldwide transmission of monkeypox and synthetic biology tools that allow the potential reconstruction of extinct viruses, we show that studying historical and ancient virus evolution has never been more topical.",

Patients who had at least one Bx/TSD dispensing from April 2021 to March 2022 were included. An algorithm was designed to determine the indication of the Bx/TSD prescription analyzing all previous drug dispensation since March 2012 following a 3-steps procedure.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 21,677 patients received at least one Bx/TSD between March 2021 and April 2022. The algorithm identified 91.7% (n = 19,884) patients with a T2 disease (AD = 18.4%, CRSwNP = 1.5%, SA = 59.5%, and CSU = 12.4%), the rest having either an association of diseases (1%) or an undetermined one (7.3%). SA was the main reason for Bx/TSD initiation (52%), followed by AD (29%), CSU (14%) and CRSwNP (5%). For SA patients already under biologic at entry, omalizumab was the most frequently prescribed (48%) followed by benralizumab, mepolizumab (22% each) and dupilumab (8%). Dupilumab was mostly prescribed for AD patients (89% for patient-initiated vs 96% for patient-renewed) followed by baricitinib.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe algorithm was able to identify patients with T2 diseases under Bx/TSD treatments. This tool may help to follow the evolution of prescription patterns in the future.\n\nPlain Language Summary\n\nNowadays, physicians have a choice of multiple biologics. Although some prospective cohorts of patients receiving those therapeutics exist, there are very few large up-to-date databases. Our algorithm based on a nationwide dynamic dispensing database was able to identify the T2 diseases of patients under biologics or targeted synthetic drugs and to characterize this population. This is a step toward a better understanding and monitoring of prescription patterns in a nationwide setting.",

      "abstract": " Introduction: The transparency of data on the value chain of medicines is crucial for the study and monitoring of the pharmaceutical system. These data may impact medicine pricing negotiations, contribute to patient access to pharmaceutical products, and strengthen health systems.\n\n Objective: This study analyzed the national strategies to ensure the transparency of data from medicine cost development to marketing in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia.\n\n Method: A descriptive study was carried out by searching databases, reports, documents, and scientific articles published between January and August 2022 related to rules on transparency and databases, including 1) marketing authorization; 2) pricing; 3) intellectual property; 4) clinical trials; 5) research and development (R&D); and 6) health technology assessment (HTA) of selected biopharmaceuticals.\n\n Results: Transparency data, rules, and information are not uniform. The infostructures (organizational capacity for collecting and distributing information) regarding the pharmaceutical value chain in these three countries face limitations in appropriate measures to publicly share data and evidence, including pre-clinical data, clinical data, and costs. None of the countries require transparency about data on research and development costs. All three countries present similar publicization of data on marketing authorization and intellectual property, with some differences. The significant limitations in Argentina include the absence of formal price regulation and data on the volume of medicine purchased and respective amounts paid. Among the three countries, Brazil showed a higher degree of information transparency, perhaps due to the legal regulation that guarantees citizens access to information of public interest. Brazil also stands out in terms of the public availability of HTA reports and pricing, in addition to the highest volume of information. In contrast, Colombia has in place a decree that allows 5 years of trial data exclusivity for new medicines, an act contrary to data transparency. Despite the different stages of transparency, no country has evidenced a robust use of these data in public policy decision-making.\n\n Conclusion: The results reinforce the presence of information asymmetry between stakeholders, data fragmentation, data gaps and overlap, and difficulty in comparing available data across the three countries and the use of these data nationally to produce evidence.",

      "abstract": "The term new genomic techniques (NGTs) is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of techniques that can alter the genetic material of an organism and that have emerged or have been developed since 2001, when the existing genetically modified organism (GMO) legislation was adopted. The analytical framework used to detect GMOs in Europe is an established single harmonized procedure that is mandatory for the authorization of GM food and feed, thus generating a reliable, transparent, and effective labeling scheme for GMO products. However, NGT products can challenge the implementation and enforcement of the current regulatory system in the EU, relating in particular to the detection of NGT products that contain no foreign genetic material. Consequently, the current detection methods might fail to meet the minimum performance requirements. Although existing detection methods may be able to detect and quantify even small alterations in the genome, this does not necessarily confirm the distinction between products resulting from NGTs subject to the GMO legislation and other products. Therefore, this study provides a stepwise approach for the in silico prediction of PCR systems' specificity by testing a bioinformatics pipeline for amplicon and primer set searches in current genomic databases. In addition, it also empirically tested the PCR system evaluated during the in silico analysis. Two mutant genotypes produced by CRISPR-Cas9 in Arabidopsis thaliana were used as a case study. Overall, our results demonstrate that the single PCR system developed for identifying a nucleotide insertion in the grf1-3 genotype has multiple matches in the databases, which do not enable the discrimination of this mutated event. Empirical assays further support this demonstration. In contrast, the second mutated genotype, grf8-61, which contains a -3 bp deletion, did not yield any matches in the sequence variant database. However, the primer sequences were not efficient during the empirical assay. Our approach represents a first step in decision making for analytical methods for NGT detection, identification, and quantification in light of the European labeling regulations.",

      "abstract": "Large scale databases are critical for helping scientists decipher long-term patterns in human evolution. This paper describes the conception and development of such a research database and illustrates how big data can be harnessed to formulate new ideas about the past. The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH) is a transdisciplinary research center whose aim is to study the origins of culture and the multifaceted aspects of human expansions across Africa and Eurasia over the last three million years. To support its research, the ROCEEH team developed an online tool named the ROCEEH Out of Africa Database (ROAD) and implemented its web-based applications. ROAD integrates geographical data as well as archaeological, paleoanthropological, paleontological and paleobotanical content within a robust chronological framework. In fact, a unique feature of ROAD is its ability to dynamically link scientific data both spatially and temporally, thereby allowing its reuse in ways that were not originally conceived. The data stem from published sources spanning the last 150 years, including those generated by the research team. Descriptions of these data rely on the development of a standardized vocabulary and profit from online explanations of each table and attribute. By synthesizing legacy data, ROAD facilitates the reuse of heritage data in novel ways. Database queries yield structured information in a variety of interoperable formats. By visualizing data on maps, users can explore this vast dataset and develop their own theories. By downloading data, users can conduct further quantitative analyses, for example with Geographic Information Systems, modeling programs and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we demonstrate the innovative nature of ROAD and show how it helps scientists studying human evolution to access datasets from different fields, thereby connecting the social and natural sciences. Because it permits the reuse of \"old\" data in new ways, ROAD is now an indispensable tool for researchers of human evolution and paleogeography.",

      "title": "Digital Sequence Information and the Access and Benefit-Sharing Obligation of the Convention on Biological Diversity",
      "abstract": "With the advent of synthetic biology, scientists are increasingly relying on digital sequence information, instead of physical genetic resources. This article examines the potential impact of this shift on the access and benefit-sharing (ABS) regime of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol. These treaties require benefit-sharing with the owners of genetic resources. However, whether \"genetic resources\" include digital sequence information is unsettled. The CBD conceives genetic resources as genetic material containing functional units of heredity. \"Material\" implies tangibility, and for some scholars, \"functional units of heredity,\" undefined in both treaties, mean full-coding sequences. This article argues that digital sequence information obtained from physical genetic resources, full-coding or not, should be treated as genetic resources. Literal construction of the CBD risks eroding its usefulness and the ABS regime. This is because through bioinformatics, sequence information can easily be obtained from genetic resources for utilization, without physically moving them or concluding ABS agreement with owners. The CBD must evolve with scientific progress also because sequence functionality depends on the state of knowledge. These arguments are vindicated by domestic ABS laws equating genetic information with genetic resources; Nagoya Protocol provisions deeming research exploiting the genetic composition of genetic resources as utilization of genetic resources; and CBD provisions requiring the sharing of benefits from the utilization of genetic resources. Moreover, treaty interpretation and case law demand that generic, scientific terms, such as \"genetic resources\" and \"functional units of heredity\" be interpreted in an evolutionary manner to capture scientific developments.",

      "abstract": " Introduction: The positive identification of xenobiotics and their metabolites in human biosamples is an integral aspect of exposomics research, yet challenges in compound annotation and identification continue to limit the feasibility of comprehensive identification of total chemical exposure. Nonetheless, the adoption of in silico tools such as metabolite prediction software, QSAR-ready structural conversion workflows, and molecular standards databases can aid in identifying novel compounds in untargeted mass spectral investigations, permitting the assessment of a more expansive pool of compounds for human health hazard. This strategy is particularly applicable when it comes to flame retardant chemicals. The population is ubiquitously exposed to flame retardants, and evidence implicates some of these compounds as developmental neurotoxicants, endocrine disruptors, reproductive toxicants, immunotoxicants, and carcinogens. However, many flame retardants are poorly characterized, have not been linked to a definitive mode of toxic action, and are known to share metabolic breakdown products which may themselves harbor toxicity. As U.S. regulatory bodies begin to pursue a subclass- based risk assessment of organohalogen flame retardants, little consideration has been paid to the role of potentially toxic metabolites, or to expanding the identification of parent flame retardants and their metabolic breakdown products in human biosamples to better inform the human health hazards imposed by these compounds.\n\n Methods: The purpose of this study is to utilize publicly available in silico tools to 1) characterize the structural and metabolic fates of proposed flame retardant classes, 2) predict first pass metabolites, 3) ascertain whether metabolic products segregate among parent flame retardant classification patterns, and 4) assess the existing coverage in of these compounds in mass spectral database.\n\n Results: We found that flame retardant classes as currently defined by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) are structurally diverse, with highly variable predicted pharmacokinetic properties and metabolic fates among member compounds. The vast majority of flame retardants (96%) and their predicted metabolites (99%) are not present in spectral databases, posing a challenge for identifying these compounds in human biosamples. However, we also demonstrate the utility of publicly available in silico methods in generating a fit for purpose synthetic spectral library for flame retardants and their metabolites that have yet to be identified in human biosamples.\n\n Discussion: In conclusion, exposomics studies making use of fit-for-purpose synthetic spectral databases will better resolve internal exposure and windows of vulnerability associated with complex exposures to flame retardant chemicals and perturbed neurodevelopmental, reproductive, and other associated apical human health impacts.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are central to modern medicine, and yet they are mainly the products of intra and inter-kingdom evolutionary warfare. To understand how nature evolves antibiotics around a common mechanism of action, we investigated the origins of an extremely valuable class of compounds, lipid II targeting glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs, exemplified by teicoplanin and vancomycin), which are used as last resort for the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Using a molecule-centred approach and computational techniques, we first predicted the nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line of paleomycin, the ancestral parent of lipid II targeting GPAs. Subsequently, we employed synthetic biology techniques to produce the predicted peptide and validated its antibiotic activity. We revealed the structure of paleomycin, which enabled us to address how nature morphs a peptide antibiotic scaffold through evolution. In doing so, we obtained temporal snapshots of key selection domains in nonribosomal peptide synthesis during the biosynthetic journey from ancestral, teicoplanin-like GPAs to modern GPAs such as vancomycin. Our study demonstrates the synergy of computational techniques and synthetic biology approaches enabling us to journey back in time, trace the temporal evolution of antibiotics, and revive these ancestral molecules. It also reveals the optimisation strategies nature has applied to evolve modern GPAs, laying the foundation for future efforts to engineer this important class of antimicrobial agents.\n\nGlycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are microbial natural products synthesized by multiple enzymes, including a nonribosomal peptide synthetase for assembly of the peptide core.

Modern omics and computational approaches are changing the field, from merely disease-specific observational models into target-specific predictive models. Traditionally, toxicology has strong links with other fields such as biology, chemistry, pharmacology and medicine. With the rise of synthetic and new engineered materials, alongside ongoing prioritisation needs in chemical risk assessment for existing chemicals, early predictive evaluations are becoming of utmost importance to both scientific and regulatory purposes. ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe. To coordinate the linkage of various life science efforts around modern predictive toxicology, the establishment of a new ELIXIR Community is seen as instrumental. In the past few years, joint efforts, building on incidental overlap, have been piloted in the context of ELIXIR. For example, the EU-ToxRisk, diXa, HeCaToS, transQST, and the nanotoxicology community have worked with the ELIXIR TeSS, Bioschemas, and Compute Platforms and activities. In 2018, a core group of interested parties wrote a proposal, outlining a sketch of what this new ELIXIR Toxicology Community would look like. A recent workshop (held September 30th to October 1st, 2020) extended this into an ELIXIR Toxicology roadmap and a shortlist of limited investment-high gain collaborations to give body to this new community.

      "title": "The positive impact on translational research of Fondazione italiana di ricerca per la Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica (AriSLA), a non-profit foundation focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Convergence of ex-ante evaluation and ex-post outcomes when goals are set upfront",
      "abstract": "Charities investing on rare disease research greatly contribute to generate ground-breaking knowledge with the clear goal of finding a cure for their condition of interest. Although the amount of their investments may be relatively small compared to major funders, the advocacy groups' clear mission promotes innovative research and aggregates highly motivated and mission-oriented scientists. Here, we illustrate the case of Fondazione italiana di ricerca per la Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica (AriSLA), the main Italian funding agency entirely dedicated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research. An international benchmark analysis of publications derived from AriSLA-funded projects indicated that their mean relative citation ratio values (iCite dashboard, National Institutes of Health, U.S.) were very high, suggesting a strong influence on the referring international scientific community. An interesting trend of research toward translation based on the \"triangle of biomedicine\" and paper citations (iCite) was also observed. Qualitative analysis on researchers' accomplishments was convergent with the bibliometric data, indicating a high level of performance of several working groups, lines of research that speak of progression toward clinical translation, and one study that has progressed from the investigation of cellular mechanisms to a Phase 2 international clinical trial. The key elements of the success of the AriSLA investment lie in: (i) the clear definition of the objectives (research with potential impact on patients, no matter how far), (ii) a rigorous peer-review process entrusted to an international panel of experts, (iii) diversification of the portfolio with ad hoc selection criteria, which also contributed to bringing new experts and younger scientists to the field, and (iv) a close interaction of AriSLA stakeholders with scientists, who developed a strong sense of belonging. Periodic review of the portfolio of investments is a vital practice for funding agencies. Sharing information between funding agencies about their own policies and research assessment methods and outcomes help guide the international debate on funding strategies and research directions to be undertaken, particularly in the field of rare diseases, where synergy is a relevant enabling factor.",

Studies in recent years have shown that eccDNA is often enriched during tumors and aging, and participates in the development of cell physiological activities in a special way, so people have paid more and more attention to the eccDNA, and it has also become a critical new topic in modern biological research.\n\nDescription\n\nWe built a database to collect eccDNA, including animals, plants and fungi, and provide researchers with an eccDNA retrieval platform. The collected eccDNAs were processed in a uniform format and classified according to the species to which it belongs and the chromosome of the source. Each eccDNA record contained sequence length, start and end sites on the corresponding chromosome, order of the bases, genomic elements such as genes and transposons, and other information in the respective sequencing experiment. All the data were stored into the TeCD (The eccDNA Collection Database) and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) sequence alignment function was also added into the database for analyzing the potential eccDNA sequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe built TeCD, a platform for users to search and obtain eccDNA data, and analyzed the possible potential functions of eccDNA. These findings may provide a basis and direction for researchers to further explore the biological significance of eccDNA in the future.",

Thousands of studies confirmed that the plant-derived medicines could play positive therapeutic effects on the patients with viral diseases. Since thousands of antiviral phytochemicals have been identified as lifesaving drugs in medical research, a comprehensive database is highly desirable to integrate the medicinal plants with their different medicinal properties. Therefore, we provided a friendly antiviral phytochemical database AVPCD covering 2537 antiviral phytochemicals from 383 medicinal compounds and 319 different families with annotation of their scientific, family and common names, along with the parts used, disease information, active compounds, links of relevant articles for COVID-19, cancer, HIV and malaria. Furthermore, each compound in AVPCD was annotated with its 2D and 3D structure, molecular formula, molecular weight, isomeric SMILES, InChI, InChI Key and IUPAC name and 21 other properties. Each compound was annotated with more than 20 properties. Specifically, a scoring method was designed to measure the confidence of each phytochemical for the viral diseases. In addition, we constructed a user-friendly platform with several powerful modules for searching and browsing the details of all phytochemicals. We believe this database will facilitate global researchers, drug developers and health practitioners in obtaining useful information against viral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Currently, livestock and poultry farming is gradually developing towards modernization and scale, and closed livestock and poultry farms are widely used for poultry feeding management, but at the same time, the farming risks of large-scale farms are increasing. In this paper, based on the study of wireless sensor networks and biological neural network models, the environmental factors that mainly affect the growth of domestic rabbits are analyzed as an example, and the technology is used to design and implement an environmental monitoring system for modern farms. The design of the system is divided into three main parts: hardware design of each node, software design, and upper computer monitoring software design. The hardware part of the system uses coordinator nodes, router nodes, sensor nodes, and control nodes to form a wireless sensor network in the farm, carries out the hardware circuit design of each node, and based on the protocol stack, designs the software program of each node to realize the collection, transmission, and regulation of environmental information in the farm. In the upper computer part, the design and development of the upper computer monitoring software interface are used to complete the real-time display of environmental data, historical query, database storage, and curve drawing, and to design a remote client data query system based on the architecture to realize the query of environmental data of the farm by remote users and to carry out monitoring fault intelligent identification alarm. At the same time, the paper investigates the optimal deployment of wireless sensor network nodes and searches for the optimal location of sensor nodes through an improved biological neural network algorithm to maximize the network coverage and reduce the coverage of blind areas, and conducts simulation experiments with the coverage rate of a rabbit farm as the optimization target.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nSequencing technologies, in particular RNASeq, have become critical tools in the design, build, test and learn cycle of synthetic biology. They provide a better understanding of synthetic designs, and they help identify ways to improve and select designs. While these data are beneficial to design, their collection and analysis is a complex, multistep process that has implications on both discovery and reproducibility of experiments. Additionally, tool parameters, experimental metadata, normalization of data and standardization of file formats present challenges that are computationally intensive. This calls for high-throughput pipelines expressly designed to handle the combinatorial and longitudinal nature of synthetic biology. In this paper, we present a pipeline to maximize the analytical reproducibility of RNASeq for synthetic biologists. We also explore the impact of reproducibility on the validation of machine learning models. We present the design of a pipeline that combines traditional RNASeq data processing tools with structured metadata tracking to allow for the exploration of the combinatorial design in a high-throughput and reproducible manner. We then demonstrate utility via two different experiments: a control comparison experiment and a machine learning model experiment. The first experiment compares datasets collected from identical biological controls across multiple days for two different organisms. It shows that a reproducible experimental protocol for one organism does not guarantee reproducibility in another. The second experiment quantifies the differences in experimental runs from multiple perspectives. It shows that the lack of reproducibility from these different perspectives can place an upper bound on the validation of machine learning models trained on RNASeq data.\n\n Graphical Abstract ",

However, with the climate change projections showing that droughts and heatwaves becoming common in much of the globe, there is a severe threat of a sharp decline in crop yields. Thus, developing crop varieties with inbuilt genetic tolerance to environmental stresses is urgently needed. Selective breeding based on genetic diversity is not keeping up with the growing demand for food and feed. However, the emergence of contemporary plant genetic engineering, genome-editing, and synthetic biology offer precise tools for developing crops that can sustain productivity under stress conditions. Here, we summarize the systems biology-level understanding of regulatory pathways involved in perception, signalling, and protective processes activated in response to unfavourable environmental conditions. The potential role of noncoding RNAs in the regulation of abiotic stress responses has also been highlighted. Further, examples of imparting abiotic stress tolerance by genetic engineering are discussed. Additionally, we provide perspectives on the rational design of abiotic stress tolerance through synthetic biology and list various bioparts that can be used to design synthetic gene circuits whose stress-protective functions can be switched on/off in response to environmental cues.",

In this study, transcriptomics was used to analyze mRNA in these three parts of yak oviduct. The results showed that there were 325 up-regulated genes and 282 down-regulated genes in the infundibulum and ampulla. Moreover, there were 234 up-regulated genes and 776 down-regulated genes in the isthmus and ampulla, as well as 873 up-regulated genes and 297 down-regulated genes in the infundibulum and isthmus. The expression of C3 in the infundibulum was significantly higher than that in the ampulla and isthmus. The expression of FAU in the isthmus was significantly lower than that in the ampulla and infundibulum, and the expression of EEF1A1 in the ampulla was significantly higher than that in the ampulla and infundibulum. When the infundibulum was compared with the ampulla and isthmus, it was found that the up-regulated genes were enriched in the lysosome, phagosome, staphylococcus aureus infection, and leishmaniasis pathway. When the isthmus was compared with the ampulla and infundibulum, the up-regulated genes were present in the apoptosis pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, and viral myocarditis pathway.

Schisandra chinensis fruit was used as an astringent tonic to astringe the lungs and the kidneys, replenish energy, promote the production of body fluids, tonify the kidney, and induce sedation. The components of S. chinensis, such as its stems (SS), leaves (SL), and roots (SR), have drawn little attention regarding their metabolites and bioactivities. In this study, a strategy of combining a chemical database with the Progenesis QI informatics platform was applied to characterize the metabolites. A total of 332 compounds were tentatively identified, including lignans, triterpenoids, flavonoids, tannins, and other compound classes. Heatmap and principal component analysis (PCA) showed remarkable differences in different parts of the plants. By multiple orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analyses (OPLS-DA), 76 compounds were identified as potential marker compounds that differentiate these different plant parts. Based on the variable influence on the projection score from OPLS-DA, the active substances including gomisin D, schisandrol B, schisantherin C, kadsuranin, and kadlongilactone F supported the fact that the biological activity of the roots was higher than that of the fruit. These substances can be used as marker compounds in the plant roots, which likely contribute to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The plant roots could be a new medicinal source that exhibits better activity than that of traditional medicinal parts, which makes them worth exploring.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe rate of biological data generation has increased dramatically in recent years, which has driven the importance of databases as a resource to guide innovation and the generation of biological insights. Given the complexity and scale of these databases, automatic data classification is often required. Biological data sets are often hierarchical in nature, with varying degrees of complexity, imposing different challenges to train, test and validate accurate and generalizable classification models. While some approaches to classify hierarchical data have been proposed, no guidelines regarding their utility, applicability and limitations have been explored or implemented. These include 'Local' approaches considering the hierarchy, building models per level or node, and 'Global' hierarchical classification, using a flat classification approach. To fill this gap, here we have systematically contrasted the performance of 'Local per Level' and 'Local per Node' approaches with a 'Global' approach applied to two different hierarchical datasets: BioLip and CATH. The results show how different components of hierarchical data sets, such as variation coefficient and prediction by depth, can guide the choice of appropriate classification schemes. Finally, we provide guidelines to support this process when embarking on a hierarchical classification task, which will help optimize computational resources and predictive performance.",

Subsequently, topology optimization and three-dimensional (3D) printing were performed, and the properties of the manufactured plate were probed. The results showed that the maximum displacement of the plate was 4.13 mm near the femoral head, the maximum stress was 5.15e2 MPa on both sides of the plate across its entire length, and the stress concentration decreased following topology optimization. The plate with optimized topology and filled with porous structure has a good filling effect. The final mass of the H-shaped plate was 12.05 g, while that of the B-shaped plate was 11.05 g, which dropped by 20.93% and 27.49%, respectively, compared with the original plate. The surface of the 3D-printed plate was bright and new, with a clear pore structure and good lap joint.

      "abstract": "This comprehensive review focuses on polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a synthetic thermoplastic polymer, for applications in dentistry. As a high-performance polymer, PEEK is intrinsically robust yet biocompatible, making it an ideal substitute for titanium:the current gold standard in dentistry. PEEK, however, is also inert due to its low surface energy and brings challenges when employed in dentistry. Inert PEEK often falls short of achieving a few critical requirements of clinical dental materials, such as adhesiveness, osseoconductivity, antibacterial properties, and resistance to tribocorrosion. This study aims to review these properties and explore the various surface modification strategies that enhance the performance of PEEK. Literatures searches were conducted on Google Scholar, Research Gate, and PubMed databases using PEEK, polyetheretherketone, osseointegration of PEEK, PEEK in dentistry, tribology of PEEK, surface modifications, dental applications, bonding strength, surface topography, adhesive in dentistry, and dental implant as keywords. Literature on the topics of surface modification to increase adhesiveness, tribology, and osseointegration of PEEK were included in the review. The unavailability of full texts was considered when excluding literature. Surface modifications via chemical strategies (such as sulfonation, plasma treatment, UV treatment, surface coating, surface polymerization, etc.) and/or physical approaches (such as sandblasting, laser treatment, accelerated neutral atom beam, layer-by-layer assembly, particle leaching, etc.) discussed in the literature are summarized and compared. Further, approaches such as the incorporation of bioactive materials, e.g., osteogenic agents, antibacterial agents, etc., to enhance the abovementioned desired properties are explored. This review presents surface modification as a critical and essential approach to enhance the biological performance of PEEK in dentistry by retaining its mechanical robustness.",

      "title": "Optimized osteogenesis of biological hydroxyapatite-based bone grafting materials by ion doping and osteoimmunomodulation.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biological hydroxyapatite (BHA)-based bone grafting materials have been widely used for bone regeneration in implant surgery. Much effort has been made in the improvement of their osteogenic property as it remains unsatisfactory for clinical use. Osteoimmunomodulation plays a significant role in bone regeneration, which is highly related to active inorganic ions. Therefore, attempts have been made to obtain osteoimmunomodulatory BHA-based bone grafting materials with optimized osteogenic property by ion doping. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and discuss the active inorganic ions doped into BHA and their effects on BHA-based bone grafting materials. METHOD: A literature search was performed in databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science and PubMed, with the elementary keywords of \"ion doped\" and \"biological hydroxyapatite\", as well as several supplementary keywords. All document types were included in this search. The searching period and language were not limited and kept updated to 2022. RESULTS: A total of 32 articles were finally included, of which 32 discussed the physiochemical properties of BHA-based biomaterials, while 12 investigated their biological features in vitro, and only three examined their biological performance in vivo. Various ions were doped into BHA, including fluoride, zinc, magnesium and lithium. Such ions improved the biological performance of BHA-based biomaterials, which was attributed to their osteoimmunomodulatory effect. CONCLUSION: The doping of active inorganic ions is a reliable strategy to endow BHA-based biomaterials with osteoimmunomodulatory property and promote bone regeneration. Further studies are still in need to explore more ions and their effects in the crosstalk between the skeletal and immune systems.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic biology is the process of forward engineering living systems. These systems can be used to produce biobased materials, agriculture, medicine, and energy. One approach to designing these systems is to employ techniques from the design of embedded electronics. These techniques include abstraction, standards, modularity, automated design, and formal semantic models of computation. Together, these elements form the foundation of \"biodesign automation,\" where software, robotics, and microfluidic devices combine to create exciting biological systems of the future. This paper describes a \"hardware, software, wetware\" codesign vision where software tools can be made to act as \"genetic compilers\" that transform high-level specifications into engineered \"genetic circuits\" (wetware). This is followed by a process where automation equipment, well-defined experimental workflows, and microfluidic devices are explicitly designed to house, execute, and test these circuits (hardware). These systems can be used as either massively parallel experimental platforms or distributed bioremediation and biosensing devices. Next, scheduling and control algorithms (software) manage these systems' actual execution and data analysis tasks. A distinguishing feature of this approach is how all three of these aspects (hardware, software, and wetware) may be derived from the same basic specification in parallel and generated to fulfill specific cost, performance, and structural requirements.",

The regulatory components associated with monooxygenases are nature's own hydrocarbon sensors, and once functionally characterised, these components can be used to create rapid, inexpensive and sensitive biosensors for use in applications such as bioremediation and metabolic engineering. Many bacterial monooxygenases have been identified, yet the regulation of only a few of these have been investigated in detail. A wealth of genetic and functional diversity of regulatory enzymes and promoter elements still remains unexplored and unexploited, both in published genome sequences and in yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. In this review we examine in detail the current state of research on monooxygenase gene regulation, and on the development of transcription-factor-based microbial biosensors for detection of alkanes and alkenes. A new framework for the systematic characterisation of the underlying genetic components and for further development of biosensors is presented, and we identify focus areas that should be targeted to enable progression of more biosensor candidates to commercialisation and deployment in industry and in the environment.",

Three modules were integrated into HEK293 cells including an rAAV genome and multiple inducible promoters controlling the expression of AAV Rep, Cap, and helper coding sequences. The synthetic cell line generated infectious rAAV vectors upon induction. Independent control over replication and packaging activities allowed for manipulation of the fraction of capsid particles containing viral genomes, affirming the feasibility of tuning gene expression profiles in a synthetic cell line for enhancing the quality of the viral vector produced. The synthetic biology approach for rAAV production presented in this study can be exploited for scalable biomanufacturing.",

The search for prospective medicinal plants was performed by analyzing the literature in online databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed, including official WHO media sites. According to recent studies related to COVID-19, a significant number of medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunostimulatory effects have been identified. A comparative study of nine medicinal plants was conducted to determine the most suitable medicinal plant to treat coronavirus infection. According to the results of the comparative analysis, Chamaenerion angustifolium Seg. showed itself as the most prospective medicinal plant with the greatest pharmacological effect compared with other types of medicinal plants. Its therapeutic properties allow physiological relief of 18 symptoms of coronavirus infection.

      "abstract": "Currently, there is a renewed interest in cannabis-related products in different fields because of the rich phytocomplex of this plant, together with its fiber and agricultural features. In this context, the current study aims to chemically characterize different samples of fiber-type Cannabis sativa L. grown in Italy as a potential health promoting source. An ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction (UA-SLE) method was first developed and optimized to obtain a fingerprinting of the investigated phytocomplex. Analyses were carried out through an ultra high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photodiode array detector in series with triple quadrupole system with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (UHPLC-UV-ESI-MS/MS) and showed that the phytocomplex mainly includes flavonoids and non-psychotomimetic cannabinoids. The method was then applied to characterize and compare 24 samples of fiber-type Cannabis sativa L. aerial parts (mainly stems and leaves), which differed for the growth stages (from mid-vegetative to early flowering), growth land plots, and methods of drying (forced-draft oven or freeze-drying). The quali-quantitative analysis showed that a freeze-drying method seems to better preserve the chemical composition of the samples, while the location of the land plot and the growth stage of the plant (which did not comprise inflorescences) had minor influences on the chemical pattern. These results were also supported by spectrophotometric in-vitro assays (scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS+ ) radicals and inhibitory activity against tyrosinase and elastase enzymes) to investigate the potential biological activity of these samples and the contribution of non-psychotomimetic cannabinoids.",

In this study, we investigate extracts from widely used Bulgarian medicinal plants for their ability to prevent the coronavirus infection of cells by testing different mechanisms of antiviral protection, their polyphenol content, and redox-modulating capacity. Methods: The influence on the stage of viral adsorption, the inhibition of extracellular virions, and the protective effect on uninfected cells of the plant's extracts were reported by the end-point dilution method, and virus titer (in Delta lgs) was determined as compared to the untreated controls. The total content of polyphenols and flavonoids was also determined. We tested the antioxidant power of the extracts by their ability to inhibit the generation of superoxide anionic radicals and to scavenge DPPH radicals. We determined their iron-reducing, copper-reducing, and metal-chelating antioxidant powers. Results: Most of the extracts tested suppress the extracellular virions of HCov. They also inhibit the stage of viral adsorption to the host cell to varying degrees and have a protective effect on healthy cells before being subjected to viral invasion. The examined extracts contained significant levels of polyphenols and quercetin-like flavonoids and showed remarkable antioxidant, radical, and redox-modulating effects. Conclusions: All of these 13 extracts from Bulgarian medicinal plants tested can act as antioxidants and antiviral and symptomatic drugs for the management of coronavirus infection.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nPractical delivery of Findable, Accessible, Reusable and Interoperable principles for research data management requires expertise, time resource, (meta)data standards and formats, software tools and public repositories. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL2) metadata standard enables FAIR sharing of the designs of synthetic biology constructs, notably in the repository of the SynBioHub platform. Large libraries of such constructs are increasingly easy to produce in practice, for example, in DNA foundries. However, manual curation of the equivalent libraries of designs remains cumbersome for a typical lab researcher, creating a barrier to data sharing. Here, we present a simple tool SynBio2Easy, which streamlines and automates operations on multiple Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) designs using Microsoft Excel  tables as metadata inputs. The tool provides several utilities for manipulation of SBOL documents and interaction with SynBioHub: for example, generation of a library of plasmids based on an original design template, bulk deposition into SynBioHub, or annotation of existing SBOL component definitions with notes and authorship information. The tool was used to generate and deposit a collection of 3661 cyanobacterium Synechocystis plasmids into the public SynBioHub repository. In the process of developing the software and uploading these data, we evaluated some aspects of the SynBioHub platform and SBOL ecosystem, and we discuss proposals for improvement that could benefit the user community. With software such as SynBio2Easy, we aim to deliver a user-driven tooling to make FAIR a reality at all stages of the project lifecycle in synthetic biology research.\n\n Graphical Abstract ",

Once assembled, the plasmid was then used to generate a stable transfectant T. b. brucei cell line. To test the performance of the oscillatory SGN, a novel experimental setup was established to capture images of the fluorescent signal from motion-restricted live cells. Data captured were consistent with oscillatory behaviour of the SGN, with cellular fluorescence observed to oscillate with a period of 50 min, with varying amplitude and linear growth trend. This first DBTL cycle establishes a foundation for future cycles in which the SGN design and experimental monitoring setup can be further refined.\n\nSynthetic biology; Trypanosoma brucei; Live cell imaging; Synthetic gene networks; Oscillation.",

The introduction of new biological therapies (monoclonal antibodies, MAbs) in CRSwNP patients has allowed new therapeutic options for non-responders to conventional therapies and Dupilumab represents the first approved biological agent. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical clinical multidisciplinary protocol which might help clinicians involved in this field to monitor the clinical outcomes.\n\nMethods:\n\nOur centre of Rhinology and Rhino-Allergology has developed a dedicated collection form to observe the outcomes of patients treated with Dupilumab. Our research started from the indications given in EPOS 2020 as main reference. We then implemented these references in an electronic database trying to apply Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) in current clinical practice.\n\nResults:\n\nThe result consists of three parts: an anamnestic collection data, a clinician reported outcome and two patient reported outcomes (PROMs) questionnaire, the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22). The tables we propose should provide an adequate correlation with the patients' adherence to therapy and their treatment outcomes. Such periodical evaluation (after a month, after 3 months, after 6 months and at one year) should quickly allow to monitor if the patient is correctly assuming the therapy and the eventual objective improvements.\n\nConclusions:\n\nWe propose a practical monitoring protocol formulated to analyse both objective and subjective aspects of patients with severe uncontrolled CRSwNP treated with MAbs, thus helping to define in future a better comparison between the clinical results of different institutes.",

The protocol comprises annual in-person visits with multimodal standardized assessments of medical history, rater-based disability staging, patient-report of lifestyle, diet, general health and disease specific symptoms, tests of motor, cognitive and visual functions, structural imaging of the neuroaxis and retina and extensive sampling of biological specimen.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe BERLimmun database allows to investigate multiple key aspects of neuroimmunological diseases, such as immunological differences between diagnoses or compared to healthy participants, interrelations between findings of functional impairment and structural change, trajectories of change for different biomarkers over time and, importantly, to study determinants of the long-term disease course. BERLimmun opens an opportunity to a better understanding and distinction of neuroimmunological diseases.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12883-022-02986-7.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\n5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is one of the most prevalent covalent modifications on RNA. It is known to regulate a broad variety of RNA functions, including nuclear export, RNA stability and translation. Here, we present m5C-Atlas, a database for comprehensive collection and annotation of RNA 5-methylcytosine. The database contains 166 540 m5C sites in 13 species identified from 5 base-resolution epitranscriptome profiling technologies. Moreover, condition-specific methylation levels are quantified from 351 RNA bisulfite sequencing samples gathered from 22 different studies via an integrative pipeline. The database also presents several novel features, such as the evolutionary conservation of a m5C locus, its association with SNPs, and any relevance to RNA secondary structure. All m5C-atlas data are accessible through a user-friendly interface, in which the m5C epitranscriptomes can be freely explored, shared, and annotated with putative post-transcriptional mechanisms (e.g. RBP intermolecular interaction with RNA, microRNA interaction and splicing sites). Together, these resources offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring m5C epitranscriptomes. The m5C-Atlas database is freely accessible at https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/m5c-atlas.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nRBM10's function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has rarely been addressed. We intend to explore the prognostic significance and therapeutic meaning of RBM10 in HCC in this study.\n\nMethods\n\nMultiple common databases were integrated to analyze the expression status and prognostic meaning of RBM10 in HCC. The relationship between RBM10 mRNA level and clinical features was also assessed. Multiple enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes between RBM10 high- and low- transcription groups were constructed by using R software (version 4.0.2). A Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction network between RBM10 and other proteins. A tumor immune estimation resource database was employed to identify the relationship between RBM10 expression and immune cell infiltrates. The prognostic value of RBM10 expression was validated in our HCC cohort by immunohistochemistry test.\n\nResults\n\nThe transcription of RBM10 mRNA was positively correlated with tumor histologic grade (p < 0.001), T classification (p < 0.001), and tumor stage (p < 0.001). High transcription of RBM10 in HCC predicted a dismal overall survival (p = 0.0037) and recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis all revealed that RBM10 was involved in the regulation of cell cycle, DNA replication, and immune-related pathways. Tumor immune estimation analysis revealed that RBM10 transcription was positively related to multiple immune cell infiltrates and the expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1.\n\nConclusion\n\nRBM10 was demonstrated to be a dismal prognostic factor and a potential biomarker for immune therapy in HCC in that it may be involved in the immune-related signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nLiver cancer is among the leading causes of death related to cancer around the world. The most frequent type of human liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is an emerging hallmark that plays a promoting role in numerous malignancies. This study aimed to discover a FA metabolism-related risk signature and formulate a better model for HCC patients' prognosis prediction.\n\nMethods\n\nWe collected mRNA expression data and clinical parameters of patients with HCC using the TCGA databases, and the differential FA metabolism-related genes were explored. To create a risk prognostic model, we carried out the consensus clustering as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. 16 genes were used to establish a prognostic model, which was then validated in the ICGC dataset. The accuracy of the model was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, decision curve analysis (DCA) and nomogram. The immune cell infiltration level of risk genes was evaluated with single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) algorithm. To reflect the response to immunotherapy, immunophenoscore (IPS) was obtained from TCGA-LIHC. Then, the expression of the candidate risk genes (p < 0.05) was validated by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and single-cell transcriptomics. Cellular function assays were performed to revealed the biological function of HAVCR1.\n\nResults\n\nAccording to the TCGA-LIHC cohort analysis, the majority of the FA metabolism-related genes were expressed differentially in the HCC and normal tissues. The prognosis of patients with high-risk scores was observed to be worse. Multivariate COX regression analysis confirmed that the model can be employed as an independent prognosis factor for HCC patients. Furthermore, ssGSEA analysis revealed a link between the model and the levels of immune cell infiltration. Our model scoring mechanism also provides a high predictive value in HCC patients receiving anti-PDL1 immunotherapy. One of the FA metabolism-related genes, HAVCR1, displays a significant differential expression between normal and HCC cell lines. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh7, and HepG2) proliferation, motility, and invasion were all remarkably inhibited by HAVCR1 siRNA.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study identified a novel FA metabolism-related prognostic model, revealing a better potential treatment and prevention strategy for HCC.",

The main objective of this study is to find the potential biomarkers for DKD.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nTwo datasets ( and ) retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were used, combined with our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results of DKD mice (C57 BLKS-32w db/db) and non-diabetic (db/m) mice for further analysis. After processing the expression matrix of the three sets of data using R software \"Limma\", differential expression analysis was performed. The significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (:logFC: > 1, p-value < 0.05) were visualized by heatmaps and volcano plots respectively. Next, the co-expression genes expressed in the three groups of DEGs were obtained by constructing a Venn diagram. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were further analyzed the related functions and enrichment pathways of these co-expression genes. Then, qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression levels of co-expression genes in the kidney of DKD and control mice.

Although traditional antibiotics and immunosuppressants are known as the most effective and commonly used treatments, some limitations may be expected, such as limited efficacy in a small number of patients and gut flora disruption. A great many research studies have been done with respect to the etiology of IBD, while the composition of the gut microbiota is suggested as one of the most influential factors. Along with the development of synthetic biology and the continuing clarification of IBD etiology, broader prospects for novel approaches to IBD therapy could be obtained. This study presents an overview of the currently existing treatment options and possible therapeutic targets at the preclinical stage with respect to microbial synthesis technology in biological therapy. This study is highly correlated to the following topics: microbiota-derived metabolites, microRNAs, cell therapy, calreticulin, live biotherapeutic products (LBP), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), bacteriophages, engineered bacteria, and their functional secreted synthetic products for IBD medical implementation. Considering microorganisms as the main therapeutic component, as a result, the related clinical trial stability, effectiveness, and safety analysis may be the major challenges for upcoming research.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nSynthetic lethality (SL) occurs between two genes when the inactivation of either gene alone has no effect on cell survival but the inactivation of both genes results in cell death. SL-based therapy has become one of the most promising targeted cancer therapies in the last decade as PARP inhibitors achieve great success in the clinic. The key point to exploiting SL-based cancer therapy is the identification of robust SL pairs. Although many wet-lab-based methods have been developed to screen SL pairs, known SL pairs are less than 0.1% of all potential pairs due to large number of human gene combinations. Computational prediction methods complement wet-lab-based methods to effectively reduce the search space of SL pairs. In this paper, we review the recent applications of computational methods and commonly used databases for SL prediction. First, we introduce the concept of SL and its screening methods. Second, various SL-related data resources are summarized. Then, computational methods including statistical-based methods, network-based methods, classical machine learning methods and deep learning methods for SL prediction are summarized. In particular, we elaborate on the negative sampling methods applied in these models. Next, representative tools for SL prediction are introduced.

Total bioactive content, high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) polyphenolic quantification, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis were utilized to evaluate the phytochemical composition. Antioxidant [including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH)], 2,2'-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelation assays] and enzyme inhibition [against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and tyrosinase] assays were carried out for biological evaluation. The cytotoxicity was tested against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cell lines. The root-methanol extract contained the highest levels of phenolics (37.69 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) and flavonoids (83.0 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract) contents, and was also the most active for DPPH (50.04 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract) and CUPRAC (139.96 mg Trolox equivalent /g extract) antioxidant assays. Likewise, the aerial-methanol extract exhibited maximum activity for ABTS (94.05 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract) and FRAP (64.23 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract) assays. The aerial-DCM extract was noted to be a convincing cholinesterase (AChE; 4.01 and BChE; 4.28 mg galantamine equivalent/g extract), and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (1.92 mmol acarbose equivalent/g extract).

      "abstract": "Background\n\nGenomics and virology are unquestionably important, but complex, domains being investigated by a large number of scientists. The need to facilitate and support work within these domains requires sharing of databases, although it is often difficult to do so because of the different ways in which data is represented across the databases. To foster semantic interoperability, models are needed that provide a deep understanding and interpretation of the concepts in a domain, so that the data can be consistently interpreted among researchers.\n\nResults\n\nIn this research, we propose the use of conceptual models to support semantic interoperability among databases and assess their ontological clarity to support their effective use. This modeling effort is illustrated by its application to the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM) that captures and represents the sequencing of viruses, inspired by the need to understand the genomic aspects of the virus responsible for COVID-19. For achieving semantic clarity on the VCM, we leverage the \"ontological unpacking\" method, a process of ontological analysis that reveals the ontological foundation of the information that is represented in a conceptual model. This is accomplished by applying the stereotypes of the OntoUML ontology-driven conceptual modeling language.As a result, we propose a new OntoVCM, an ontologically grounded model, based on the initial VCM, but with guaranteed interoperability among the data sources that employ it.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe propose and illustrate how the unpacking of the Viral Conceptual Model resolves several issues related to semantic interoperability, the importance of which is recognized by the \"I\" in FAIR principles. The research addresses conceptual uncertainty within the domain of SARS-CoV-2 data and knowledge.The method employed provides the basis for further analyses of complex models currently used in life science applications, but lacking ontological grounding, subsequently hindering the interoperability needed for scientists to progress their research.",

      "title": "Understanding signaling and metabolic paths using semantified and harmonized information about biological interactions",
      "abstract": "To grasp the complexity of biological processes, the biological knowledge is often translated into schematic diagrams of, for example, signalling and metabolic pathways. These pathway diagrams describe relevant connections between biological entities and incorporate domain knowledge in a visual format making it easier for humans to interpret. Still, these diagrams can be represented in machine readable formats, as done in the KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways databases. However, while humans are good at interpreting the message of the creators of diagrams, algorithms struggle when the diversity in drawing approaches increases. WikiPathways supports multiple drawing styles which need harmonizing to offer semantically enriched access. Particularly challenging, here, are the interactions between the biological entities that underlie the biological causality. These interactions provide information about the biological process (metabolic conversion, inhibition, etc.), the direction, and the participating entities. Availability of the interactions in a semantic and harmonized format is essential for searching the full network of biological interactions. We here study how the graphically-modelled biological knowledge in diagrams can be semantified and harmonized, and exemplify how the resulting data is used to programmatically answer biological questions. We find that we can translate graphically modelled knowledge to a sufficient degree into a semantic model and discuss some of the current limitations. We then use this to show that reproducible notebooks can be used to explore up- and downstream targets of MECP2 and to analyse the sphingolipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate that most of the graphical biological knowledge from WikiPathways is modelled into the semantic layer with the semantic information intact and connectivity information preserved. Being able to evaluate how biological elements affect each other is useful and allows, for example, the identification of up or downstream targets that will have a similar effect when modified.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity data of the nervous system and subdivisions, such as the brainstem, cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei, are necessary to understand connectional structures, predict effects of connectional disorders and simulate network dynamics. For that purpose, a database was built and analyzed which comprises all known directed and weighted connections within the rat brainstem. A longterm metastudy of original research publications describing tract tracing results form the foundation of the brainstem connectome (BC) database which can be analyzed directly in the framework neuroVIISAS. The BC database can be accessed directly by connectivity tables, a web-based tool and the framework. Analysis of global and local network properties, a motif analysis, and a community analysis of the brainstem connectome provides insight into its network organization. For example, we found that BC is a scale-free network with a small-world connectivity. The Louvain modularity and weighted stochastic block matching resulted in partially matching of functions and connectivity. BC modeling was performed to demonstrate signal propagation through the somatosensory pathway which is affected in Multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nNetwork approaches that investigate the interaction between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in recent years. In parallel, network approaches that characterise the interaction between brain regions have become the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that are associated with each node in the psychometric network (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic traits and their resting-state functional connectivity associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male autistic participants (10-21 years) from the autism brain data exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our results indicate that the network-based regression approach can uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the overlap between communication and social difficulties is not reflected in the overlap between their functional brain correlates.\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe article introduces a method to combine common practices in network psychometrics and network neuroimaging. Namely, we use the unique variance in behavioural measures as regressors to identify unique neural correlates. This enables the description of brain-level and behavioural-level data into a joint network while keeping the dimensionality of the results manageable and interpretable. We illustrate this approach by showing the network of autistic traits and their correlates in resting-state functional connectivity.",

      "abstract": "Hazard assessment is the first step in nanomaterial risk assessment. The overall number of studies on the biological effects of nanomaterials or innovative materials is steadily increasing and is above 40,000. Several databases have been established to make the amount of data manageable, but these are often highly specialized or can be used only by experts. This paper describes a new database which uses an already existing data collection of about 35,000 publications. The collection from the first phase between the years 2000 and 2013 contains about 11,000 articles and this number has been reduced by specific selection criteria. The resulting publications have been evaluated for their quality regarding the toxicological content and the experimental data have been extracted. In addition to material properties, the most important value to be extracted is the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for in vivo and the no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) for in vitro studies. The correlation of the NOAEL/NOEC values with the nanomaterial properties and the investigated endpoints has been tested in projects such as the OECD-AOP project, where the available data for inflammatory responses have been analysed. In addition, special attention was paid to titanium dioxide particles and this example is used to show with searches for in vitro and in vivo experiments on possible lung toxicity what a typical result of a database query can look like. In this review, an emerging database is described that contains valuable information for nanomaterial hazard estimation and should aid in the progress of nanosafety research.",

      "title": "Development of database structure and indexing for siddha medicine system - A platform for siddha literature analytics",
      "abstract": "Background\n\nSiddha Medicine system is one among the oldest traditional systems of medicines in India and has its entire literature in the Tamil language in the form of poems (padal in tamil). Even if the siddha poems are available in public domain, they are not known to other parts of the world because, researchers of other languages are not able to understand the contents of these poems and there exists a language barrier. Hence there is a need to develop a system to extract structured information from these texts to facilitate searching, comparing, analysis and implementing.\n\nObjective\n\nThis study aimed at creating a comprehensive digital database system that systematically stores information from classical Siddha poems and to develop a web portal to facilitate information retrieval for comparative and logical analysis of Siddha content.\n\nMethods\n\nWe developed an expert system for siddha (eSS) that can collect, annotate classical siddha text, and visualizes the pattern in siddha medical prescriptions (Siddha Formulations) that can be useful for exploration in this system using modern techniques like machine learning and artificial learning. eSS has the following three aspects: (1) extracting data from Siddha classical text (2) defining the annotation method and (3) visualizing the patterns in the medical prescriptions based on multiple factors mentioned in the Siddha system of medicine. The data from three books were extracted, annotated and integrated into the developed eSS database. The annotations were used for analyzing the pattern in the drug prescriptions as a pilot work.\n\nResults\n\nOverall, 110 medicinal preparations from 2 Siddhars (Agathiyar and Theran) were extracted and annotated. The generated annotations were indexed into the data repository created in eSS. The system can compare and visualize individual and multiple prescriptions to generate a hypothesis for siddha practitioners and researchers.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe propose an eSS framework using standard siddha terminologies created by WHO to have a standard expert system for siddha. This proof-of-concept work demonstrated that the database can effectively process and visualize data from siddha formulations which can help students, researchers from siddha and other various fields to expand their research in herbal medicines.\n\nHighlights\n\nSystematically documenting and retrieving information of siddha medicine system is the pioneering effort. Analytical exploration of the siddha content is never been done before.\n\nSiddha system of medicine has innumerable number of poems. We need to keep on updating the poems in the database.\n\nWebpage developed will be useful for knowledge discovery & analytical exploration of logic underlying drug formulations using taste and other factors",

      "abstract": "Simple Summary\n\nApis mellifera Linnaeus (1758), a honey bee, is a eusocial insect widely known for its role in pollination, an essential ecosystem service for plant biodiversity, and quality of vegetables and fruit products. In addition, honey bees and bee products are valuable bioindicators of pollutants, such as airborne particulate matter, heavy metals, and pesticides. In this review, we explore the provisioning, regulating, and cultural services provided by the honey bee, an insect at the interface between human and ecosystem health.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe concept of ecosystem services is widely understood as the services and benefits thatecosystems provide to humans, and they have been categorised into provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. This article aims to provide an updated overview of the benefits that the honey bee Apis mellifera provides to humans as well as ecosystems. We revised the role of honey bees as pollinators in natural ecosystems to preserve and restore the local biodiversity of wild plants; in agro-ecosystems, this species is widely used to enhance crop yield and quality, meeting the increasing food demand. Beekeeping activity provides humans not only with high-quality food but also with substances used as raw materials and in pharmaceuticals, and in polluted areas, bees convey valuable information on the environmental presence of pollutants and their impact on human and ecosystem health. Finally, the role of the honey bee in symbolic tradition, mysticism, and the cultural values of the bee habitats are also presented. Overall, we suggest that the symbolic value of the honey bee is the most important role played by this insect species, as it may help revitalise and strengthen the intimate and reciprocal relationship between humans and the natural world, avoiding the inaccuracy of considering the ecosystems as mere providers of services to humans.",

To connect such data seamlessly, identifier (ID) conversion plays a key role. However, existing ID conversion services have disadvantages, such as covering only a limited range of biological categories of databases, not keeping up with the updates of the original databases and outputs being hard to interpret in the context of biological relations, especially when converting IDs in multiple steps.\n\nResults\n\nTogoID is an ID conversion service implementing unique features with an intuitive web interface and an application programming interface (API) for programmatic access. TogoID currently supports 65 datasets covering various biological categories. TogoID users can perform exploratory multistep conversions to find a path among IDs.

      "title": "Putative Protein Discovery from Microalgal Genomes as a Synthetic Biology Protein Library for Heavy Metal Bio-Removal",
      "abstract": "Simple Summary\n\nNowadays, heavy metal polluted wastewater is one of the global challenges that leads to an insufficient supply of clean water. Taking advantage of what nature has to offer, several organisms, including microalgae, can natively bioremediate these heavy metals. However, the effectiveness of such processes does not meet expectations, especially with the increasing amount of pollution in today's world. Therefore, with the goal of creating effective strains, synthetic biology via bioengineering is widely used as a strategy to enhance the heavy metal bio-removing capability, either by directly engineering the native ability of organisms or by transferring the ability to a more suitable host. In order to do so, a list of genes or proteins involved in the processes is crucial for stepwise engineering. Yet, a large amount of information remains to be discovered. In this work, a comprehensive library of putative proteins that are involved in heavy metal bio-removal from microalgae was constructed. Moreover, with the development of machine learning, the 3D structures of these proteins are also predicted, using machine learning-based methods, to aid the use of synthetic biology further.\n\nAbstract\n\nSynthetic biology is a principle that aims to create new biological systems with particular functions or to redesign the existing ones through bioengineering. Therefore, this principle is often utilized as a tool to put the knowledge learned to practical use in actual fields. However, there is still a great deal of information remaining to be found, and this limits the possible utilization of synthetic biology, particularly on the topic that is the focus of the present work:heavy metal bio-removal. In this work, we aim to construct a comprehensive library of putative proteins that might support heavy metal bio-removal. Hypothetical proteins were discovered from Chlorella and Scenedesmus genomes and extensively annotated. The protein structures of these putative proteins were also modeled through Alphafold2. Although a portion of this workflow has previously been demonstrated to annotate hypothetical proteins from whole genome sequences, the adaptation of such steps is yet to be done for library construction purposes. We also demonstrated further downstream steps that allow a more accurate function prediction of the hypothetical proteins by subjecting the models generated to structure-based annotation. In conclusion, a total of 72 newly discovered putative proteins were annotated with ready-to-use predicted structures available for further investigation.",

      "title": "Removing the Bottleneck: Introducing cMatch - A Lightweight Tool for Construct-Matching in Synthetic Biology",
      "abstract": "We present a software tool, called cMatch, to reconstruct and identify synthetic genetic constructs from their sequences, or a set of sub-sequences:based on two practical pieces of information: their modular structure, and libraries of components. Although developed for combinatorial pathway engineering problems and addressing their quality control (QC) bottleneck, cMatch is not restricted to these applications. QC takes place post assembly, transformation and growth. It has a simple goal, to verify that the genetic material contained in a cell matches what was intended to be built - and when it is not the case, to locate the discrepancies and estimate their severity. In terms of reproducibility/reliability, the QC step is crucial. Failure at this step requires repetition of the construction and/or sequencing steps. When performed manually or semi-manually QC is an extremely time-consuming, error prone process, which scales very poorly with the number of constructs and their complexity. To make QC frictionless and more reliable, cMatch performs an operation we have called \"construct-matching\" and automates it. Construct-matching is more thorough than simple sequence-matching, as it matches at the functional level-and quantifies the matching at the individual component level and across the whole construct. Two algorithms (called CM_1 and CM_2) are presented. They differ according to the nature of their inputs. CM_1 is the core algorithm for construct-matching and is to be used when input sequences are long enough to cover constructs in their entirety (e.g., obtained with methods such as next generation sequencing). CM_2 is an extension designed to deal with shorter data (e.g., obtained with Sanger sequencing), and that need recombining. Both algorithms are shown to yield accurate construct-matching in a few minutes (even on hardware with limited processing power), together with a set of metrics that can be used to improve the robustness of the decision-making process. To ensure reliability and reproducibility, cMatch builds on the highly validated pairwise-matching Smith-Waterman algorithm. All the tests presented have been conducted on synthetic data for challenging, yet realistic constructs - and on real data gathered during studies on a metabolic engineering example (lycopene production).",

Research in the field of ENM bioaccumulation has increased in recent years, but the compilation and statistical analysis of the available experimental data have not been updated. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of the existing literature on the bioaccumulation of eight types of nondissolvable ENMs (titanium dioxide [TiO2], aluminum oxide [Al2O3], gold [Au], fullerene [C60], carbon nanotubes, iron oxide [FeO x ], graphene, and polystyrene) in nonmammalian freshwater aquatic organisms across three trophic levels including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish. Three typical endpoints were used to assess the bioaccumulation potential: the bioconcentration factor (BCF), the bioaccumulation factor (BAF), and the biomagnification factor (BMF). Our results suggest that zooplankton has greater mean logarithmic BCF and BAF values than phytoplankton (3.31 vs. 1.42) and fish (2.04). The ENMs are biomagnified in zooplankton, with a mean BMF of 17.4, whereas trophic transfer from primary consumers (zooplankton) to secondary consumers (fish) was not observed (mean BMF of 0.13). No clear dependency was identified between the physicochemical characteristics of ENMs (e.g., primary particle size, zeta potential, or shape) and bioaccumulation, except for coated versus uncoated particles accumulated in phytoplankton. Carbonaceous ENMs were found to be more bioaccumulated than the other ENMs we considered, except for TiO2. A meta-analysis of bioaccumulation data can (1) deepen the understanding of bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of ENMs, (2) be used to support grouping strategies as a basis for a safer-by-design approach for ENMs, (3) be integrated into comprehensive hazard and risk assessments, (4) promote the standardization of testing guidelines, and (5) enhance future kinetic bioaccumulation modeling.

      "title": "Hybrid Classification/Regression Approach to QSAR Modeling of Stoichiometric Antiradical Capacity Assays' Endpoints",
      "abstract": "Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) are a widely used methodology allowing not only a better understanding of the mechanisms of chemical reactions, including radical scavenging, but also to predict the relevant properties of chemical compounds without their synthesis, isolation and experimental testing. Unlike the QSAR modeling of the kinetic antioxidant assays, modeling of the assays with stoichiometric endpoints depends strongly on the number of hydroxyl groups in the antioxidant molecule, as well as on some integral molecular descriptors characterizing the proportion of OH-groups able to enter and complete the radical scavenging reaction. In this work, we tested the feasibility of a \"hybrid\" classification/regression approach, consisting of explicit classification of individual OH-groups as involved in radical scavenging reactions, and using further the number of these OH-groups as a descriptor in simple-regression QSAR models of antiradical capacity assays with stoichiometric endpoints. A simple threshold classification based on the sum of trolox-equivalent antiradical capacity values was used, selecting OH-groups with specific radical stability- and reactivity-related electronic parameters or their combination as \"active\" or \"inactive\". We showed that this classification/regression modeling approach provides a substantial improvement of the simple-regression QSAR models over those built on the number of total phenolic OH-groups only, and yields a statistical performance similar to that of the best reported multiple-regression QSARs for antiradical capacity assays with stoichiometric endpoints.",

      "abstract": "A few decades ago, drug discovery and development were limited to a bunch of medicinal chemists working in a lab with enormous amount of testing, validations, and synthetic procedures, all contributing to considerable investments in time and wealth to get one drug out into the clinics. The advancements in computational techniques combined with a boom in multi-omics data led to the development of various bioinformatics/pharmacoinformatics/cheminformatics tools that have helped speed up the drug development process. But with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the conventional drug discovery process has been further rationalized. Extensive biological data in the form of big data present in various databases across the globe acts as the raw materials for the ML/DL-based approaches and helps in accurate identifications of patterns and models which can be used to identify therapeutically active molecules with much fewer investments on time, workforce and wealth. In this review, we have begun by introducing the general concepts in the drug discovery pipeline, followed by an outline of the fields in the drug discovery process where ML/DL can be utilized. We have also introduced ML and DL along with their applications, various learning methods, and training models used to develop the ML/DL-based algorithms. Furthermore, we have summarized various DL-based tools existing in the public domain with their application in the drug discovery paradigm which includes DL tools for identification of drug targets and drug-target interaction such as DeepCPI, DeepDTA, WideDTA, PADME DeepAffinity, and DeepPocket. Additionally, we have discussed various DL-based models used in protein structure prediction, de novo design of new chemical scaffolds, virtual screening of chemical libraries for hit identification, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) prediction, metabolite prediction, clinical trial design, and oral bioavailability prediction. In the end, we have tried to shed light on some of the successful ML/DL-based models used in the drug discovery and development pipeline while also discussing the current challenges and prospects of the application of DL tools in drug discovery and development. We believe that this review will be useful for medicinal and computational chemists searching for DL tools for use in their drug discovery projects.",

Those services are data driven, and a lot of PHI is needed not only from received care and treatments, but also from a person's normal life. Collecting, processing, storing, and sharing of the huge amount of sensitive PHI in the ecosystem cause many security, privacy, and trust challenges to be solved. The authors have studied those challenges from different perspectives using existing literature and found that current security and privacy solutions are insufficient, and for the user it is difficult to know whom to trust, and how much. Furthermore, in today's widely used privacy approaches, such as privacy as choice or control and belief or perception based trust does not work in digital health ecosystems. The authors state that it is necessary to redefine the way privacy and trust are understood in health, to develop new legislation to support new privacy and approaches, and to force the stakeholders of the health ecosystem to make their privacy and trust practices and features of their information systems available.

      "title": "DNA Authentication and Chemical Analysis of Psilocybe Mushrooms Reveal Widespread Misdeterminations in Fungaria and Inconsistencies in Metabolites",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe mushroom genus Psilocybe is best known as the core group of psychoactive mushrooms, yet basic information on their diversity, taxonomy, chemistry, and general biology is still largely lacking. In this study, we reexamined 94 Psilocybe fungarium specimens, representing 18 species, by DNA barcoding, evaluated the stability of psilocybin, psilocin, and their related tryptamine alkaloids in 25 specimens across the most commonly vouchered species (Psilocybe cubensis, Psilocybe cyanescens, and Psilocybe semilanceata), and explored the metabolome of cultivated P. cubensis. Our data show that, apart from a few well-known species, the taxonomic accuracy of specimen determinations is largely unreliable, even at the genus level. A substantial quantity of poor-quality and mislabeled sequence data in public repositories, as well as a paucity of sequences derived from types, further exacerbates the problem. Our data also support taxon- and time-dependent decay of psilocybin and psilocin, with some specimens having no detectable quantities of them. We also show that the P. cubensis metabolome possibly contains thousands of uncharacterized compounds, at least some of which may be bioactive. Taken together, our study undermines commonly held assumptions about the accuracy of names and presence of controlled substances in fungarium specimens identified as Psilocybe spp. and reveals that our understanding of the chemical diversity of these mushrooms is largely incomplete. These results have broader implications for regulatory policies pertaining to the storage and sharing of fungarium specimens as well as the use of psychoactive mushrooms for recreation and therapy.\n\nIMPORTANCE The therapeutic use of psilocybin, the active ingredient in \"magic mushrooms,\" is revolutionizing mental health care for a number of conditions, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and end-of-life care. This has spotlighted the current state of knowledge of psilocybin, including the organisms that endogenously produce it. However, because of international regulation of psilocybin as a controlled substance (often included on the same list as cocaine and heroin), basic research has lagged far behind. Our study highlights how the poor state of knowledge of even the most fundamental scientific information can impact the use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms for recreational or therapeutic applications and undermines critical assumptions that underpin their regulation by legal authorities. Our study shows that currently available chemical studies are mainly inaccurate, irreproducible, and inconsistent, that there exists a high rate of misidentification in museum collections and public databases rendering even names unreliable, and that the concentration of psilocybin and its tryptamine derivatives in three of the most commonly collected Psilocybe species (P. cubensis, P. cyanescens, and P. semilanceata) is highly variable and unstable in museum specimens spanning multiple decades, and our study generates the first-ever insight into the highly complex and largely uncharacterized metabolomic profile for the most commonly cultivated magic mushroom, P. cubensis.",

      "abstract": "The composition of honey, a complex natural product, challenges analytical methods attempting to determine its authenticity particularly in the face of sophisticated adulteration. Of the advanced analytical techniques available, only isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is generally accepted for its reproducibility and ability to detect certain added sugars, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) being subject to stakeholder differences of opinion. Herein, recent reviews of honey adulteration and the techniques to detect it are summarised in the light of which analytical reports are examined that underpinned a media article in late 2020 alleging foreign sugars in UK retailers' own brand honeys. The requirement for multiple analytical techniques leads to complex reports from which it is difficult to draw an overarching and unequivocal authenticity opinion. Thus arose two questions. (1) Is it acceptable to report an adverse interpretation without exhibiting all the supporting data? (2) How may a valid overarching authenticity opinion be derived from a large partially conflicting dataset?",

However, there are no pharmacological and phytochemical studies on most native plants. Parts of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engler, a tree from the Anacardiaceae family, are used by several traditional communities to treat injuries and health problems. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the pharmacological information about S. brasiliensis, from ethnobotanical to phytochemical and biological studies. Data collection concerning the geographical distribution of S. brasiliensis specimens was achieved through the Reflora Virtual Herbarium. The study's protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The search strategy used the keyword \"Schinopsis brasiliensis\" in the databases: PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Science Direct, Web of Science, SciFinder, and SciELO. Rayyan was used for the selection of eligible studies. In total, 35 studies were included in the paper. The most recurrent therapeutic indications were for general pain, flu and inflammation. The bark was the most studied part of the plant. The most used preparation method was decoction and infusion, followed by syrup. Phytochemical investigations indicate the presence of tannins, flavonoids, phenols, and polyphenols. Most of the substances were found in the plant's leaf and bark. Important biological activities were reported, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. S. brasiliensis is used mainly by communities in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil to treat several diseases. Pharmacological and phytochemical studies together provide scientific support for the popular knowledge of the medicinal use of S. brasiliensis. In vitro and in vivo analyses reported antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, cytotoxic, photoprotective, preservative, molluscicidal, larvicidal, and pupicidal effects. It is essential to highlight the need for future studies that elucidate the mechanisms of action of these phytocompounds.",

Coincidentally, many advanced practitioners (APs) are finding themselves at the forefront of introducing monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilars in their oncology practice. Advanced practitioners are often tasked with building the confidence of colleagues and patients who may be unfamiliar with biosimilars, skeptical about integrating them, or have yet to consider mAb biosimilars as a viable and more sustainable cancer treatment option. With this responsibility comes a number of challenges that require APs to become knowledgeable about biosimilars and approaches to their implementation.

The development of vaccine and its immediate application might be the only to escape from the grasp of this demoniac pandemic. Approximately 343 clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines are ongoing currently, and almost all countries are motivating ongoing researches at warp speed for the development of vaccines against COVID-19. This review explores the progress in the development of the vaccines, their current status of ongoing clinical research, mechanisms, and regulatory approvals. Many pharmaceutical companies are already in the endgame for manufacturing various vaccines of which some are already being marketed across the globe, while others are yet to get approval for marketing. The primary aim of this review is to compare regulatory accepted vaccines in terms of their composition, doses, regulatory status, and efficacy. The study is conducted by grouping into approved and unapproved vaccines for marketing. Different routes of administration of vaccines along with the efficacy of the routes are also presented in the review. A wide range of database and clinical trial data is reviewed for sorting out the information on different vaccines. Unfortunately, many mutations (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa, omicron etc.) of SARS-CoV-2 have attacked people in very short time, which is the great challenge for investigational vaccines. Moreover, some vaccines like Pfizer's BNT162, Oxford's ChAdOx1, Moderna's mRNA-1273, and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin have got regulatory approval in some countries for its distribution which may prove to stand tall against the pandemic.\n\nGraphical abstract",

      "abstract": "The skin is the absorption site for drug substances intended to treat loco-regional diseases, although its barrier properties limit the permeation of drug molecules. The growing knowledge of the skin structure and its physiology have supported the design of innovative nanosystems (e.g. liposomal systems) to improve the absorption of poorly skin-permeable drugs. However, despite the dozens of clinical trials started, few topically applied liposomal systems have been authorized both in the EU and the USA. Indeed, the intrinsic complexity of the topically applied liposomal systems, the higher production costs, the lack of standardized methods and the more stringent guidelines for assessing their benefit/risk balance can be seen as causes of such inefficient translation. The present work aimed to provide an overview of the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical characterization methods that can be applied to topical liposomal systems intended to be marketed as medicinal products, and the current regulatory provisions. The discussion highlights how such methodologies can be relevant for defining the critical quality attributes of the final product, and they can be usefully applied based on the phase of the life cycle of a liposomal product: to guide the formulation studies in the early stages of development, to rationally design preclinical and clinical trials, to support the pharmaceutical quality control system and to sustain post-marketing variations. The provided information can help define harmonized quality standards able to overcome the case-by-case approach currently applied by regulatory agencies in assessing the benefit/risk of the topically applied liposomal systems.\n\nGraphical abstract",

Although they grant significant insights into diagnosis and treatment, implementing data exploration into current medical databases is challenging since these are often based on a relational schema and cannot be used to easily extract information for cohort analysis and visualization. As a consequence, valuable information regarding cohort distribution or patient similarity may be missed. With the rapid advancement of biomedical technologies, new forms of data from methods such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or chromosome microarray (array CGH) are constantly being generated; hence it can be expected that the amount and complexity of medical data will rise and bring relational database systems to a limit.\n\nDescription\n\nWe present Graph4Med, a web application that relies on a graph database obtained by transforming a relational database. Graph4Med provides a straightforward visualization and analysis of a selected patient cohort. Our use case is a database of pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Along routine patients' health records it also contains results of latest technologies such as NGS data. We developed a suitable graph data schema to convert the relational data into a graph data structure and store it in Neo4j. We used NeoDash to build a dashboard for querying and displaying patients' cohort analysis. This way our tool (1) quickly displays the overview of patients' cohort information such as distributions of gender, age, mutations (fusions), diagnosis; (2) provides mutation (fusion) based similarity search and display in a maneuverable graph; (3) generates an interactive graph of any selected patient and facilitates the identification of interesting patterns among patients.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a graph database for storing and querying medical databases. Our dashboard allows a fast and interactive analysis and visualization of complex medical data. It is especially useful for patients similarity search based on mutations (fusions), of which vast amounts of data have been generated by NGS in recent years. It can discover relationships and patterns in patients cohorts that are normally hard to grasp. Expanding Graph4Med to more medical databases will bring novel insights into diagnostic and research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe postsynaptic region is the receiving part of the synapse comprising thousands of proteins forming an elaborate and dynamically changing network indispensable for the molecular mechanisms behind fundamental phenomena such as learning and memory. Despite the growing amount of information about individual protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in this network, these data are mostly scattered in the literature or stored in generic databases that are not designed to display aspects that are fundamental to the understanding of postsynaptic functions. To overcome these limitations, we collected postsynaptic PPIs complemented by a high amount of detailed structural and biological information and launched a freely available resource, the Postsynaptic Interaction Database (PSINDB), to make these data and annotations accessible. PSINDB includes tens of thousands of binding regions together with structural features, mediating and regulating the formation of PPIs, annotated with detailed experimental information about each interaction. PSINDB is expected to be useful for various aspects of molecular neurobiology research, from experimental design to network and systems biology-based modeling and analysis of changes in the protein network upon various stimuli.\n\n Database URL \n\n https://psindb.itk.ppke.hu/ ",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with DNA sequencing methods can identify TF binding sites across the genome, providing a bottom-up, mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated. ChIP provides indispensable evidence toward the goal of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of cellular adaptation and regulation, including condition-specificity. ChIP-derived data's importance and labor-intensiveness motivate its broad dissemination and reuse, which is currently an unmet need in the prokaryotic domain. To fill this gap, we present proChIPdb (prochipdb.org), an information-rich, interactive web database. This website collects public ChIP-seq/-exo data across several prokaryotes and presents them in dashboards that include curated binding sites, nucleotide-resolution genome viewers, and summary plots such as motif enrichment sequence logos. Users can search for TFs of interest or their target genes, download all data, dashboards, and visuals, and follow external links to understand regulons through biological databases and the literature.

      "abstract": "Mycelium-based composites (MBCs) have attracted growing attention due to their role in the development of eco-design methods. We concurrently analysed scientific publications, patent documents, and results of our own feasibility studies to identify the current design issues and technologies used. A literature inquiry in scientific and patent databases (WoS, Scopus, The Lens, Google Patents) pointed to 92 scientific publications and 212 patent documents. As a part of our own technological experiments, we have created several prototype products used in architectural interior design. Following the synthesis, these sources of knowledge can be concluded: 1. MBCs are inexpensive in production, ecological, and offer a high artistic value. Their weaknesses are insufficient load capacity, unfavourable water affinity, and unknown reliability. 2. The scientific literature shows that the material parameters of MBCs can be adjusted to certain needs, but there are almost infinite combinations: properties of the input biomaterials, characteristics of the fungi species, and possible parameters during the growth and subsequent processing of the MBCs. 3. The patent documents show the need for development: an effective method to increase the density and the search for technologies to obtain a more homogeneous internal structure of the composite material. 4. Our own experiments with the production of various everyday objects indicate that some disadvantages of MBCs can be considered advantages. Such an unexpected advantage is the interesting surface texture resulting from the natural inhomogeneity of the internal structure of MBCs, which can be controlled to some extent.",

The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives.

      "abstract": "Background\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in cells and tissues and are involved in biological processes and human diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that circRNAs can interact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which is considered an important aspect for investigating the function of circRNAs.\n\nResults\n\nIn this study, we design a slight variant of the capsule network, called circRB, to identify the sequence specificities of circRNAs binding to RBPs. In this model, the sequence features of circRNAs are extracted by convolution operations, and then, two dynamic routing algorithms in a capsule network are employed to discriminate between different binding sites by analysing the convolution features of binding sites. The experimental results show that the circRB method outperforms the existing computational methods. Afterwards, the trained models are applied to detect the sequence motifs on the seven circRNA-RBP bound sequence datasets and matched to known human RNA motifs. Some motifs on circular RNAs overlap with those on linear RNAs. Finally, we also predict binding sites on the reported full-length sequences of circRNAs interacting with RBPs, attempting to assist current studies. We hope that our model will contribute to better understanding the mechanisms of the interactions between RBPs and circRNAs.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn view of the poor studies about the sequence specificities of circRNA-binding proteins, we designed a classification framework called circRB based on the capsule network. The results show that the circRB method is an effective method, and it achieves higher prediction accuracy than other methods.",

This creates a barrier to use especially for non-experts, who have to come to grips with the nature of the data, the way it has been represented in the database, and the specific query languages or user interfaces by which data are accessed. These difficulties worsen in research settings, where it is common to work with many different databases. One approach to improving this situation is to allow users to pose their queries in natural language. In this work we describe a machine learning framework, Polyglotter, that in a general way supports the mapping of natural language searches to database queries. Importantly, it does not require the creation of manually annotated data for training and therefore can be applied easily to multiple domains. The framework is polyglot in the sense that it supports multiple different database engines that are accessed with a variety of query languages, including SQL and Cypher. Furthermore Polyglotter supports multi-class queries. Good performance is achieved on both toy and real databases, as well as a human-annotated WikiSQL query set. Thus Polyglotter may help database maintainers make their resources more accessible.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nGraphs are mathematical structures widely used for expressing relationships among elements when representing biomedical and biological information. On top of these representations, several analyses are performed. A common task is the search of one substructure within one graph, called target. The problem is referred to as one-to-one subgraph search, and it is known to be NP-complete. Heuristics and indexing techniques can be applied to facilitate the search. Indexing techniques are also exploited in the context of searching in a collection of target graphs, referred to as one-to-many subgraph problem. Filter-and-verification methods that use indexing approaches provide a fast pruning of target graphs or parts of them that do not contain the query. The expensive verification phase is then performed only on the subset of promising targets. Indexing strategies extract graph features at a sufficient granularity level for performing a powerful filtering step. Features are memorized in data structures allowing an efficient access. Indexing size, querying time and filtering power are key points for the development of efficient subgraph searching solutions.\n\nResults\n\nAn existing approach, GRAPES, has been shown to have good performance in terms of speed-up for both one-to-one and one-to-many cases. However, it suffers in the size of the built index. For this reason, we propose GRAPES-DD, a modified version of GRAPES in which the indexing structure has been replaced with a Decision Diagram. Decision Diagrams are a broad class of data structures widely used to encode and manipulate functions efficiently. Experiments on biomedical structures and synthetic graphs have confirmed our expectation showing that GRAPES-DD has substantially reduced the memory utilization compared to GRAPES without worsening the searching time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe use of Decision Diagrams for searching in biochemical and biological graphs is completely new and potentially promising thanks to their ability to encode compactly sets by exploiting their structure and regularity, and to manipulate entire sets of elements at once, instead of exploring each single element explicitly. Search strategies based on Decision Diagram makes the indexing for biochemical graphs, and not only, more affordable allowing us to potentially deal with huge and ever growing collections of biochemical and biological structures.",

More recently, the advent of modern genomic sequencing and the volume of data it generates has resulted in a return to the problem of local alignment.

Opti-nQL has been validated with cellular lipid extracts of human and mouse origin and with different lipid extraction methods. Among the resulting 4000 detected features, 700 and even more unique lipid molecular species have been identified covering 16 lipid sub-classes, while 400 lipids were uniquely structure defined by MS/MS. These results were obtained by analyzing an amount of lipids extract equivalent to 40 ng of proteins, being highly suitable for low abundant samples. MS analysis showed that theOpti-nQL method increases the number of identified lipids, which is evidenced by injecting 20 times less material than in microflow based chromatography, being more reproducible and accurate thus enhancing robustness of lipidomics analysis.",

Designs are encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); DNA makes biological (bio-)parts; bioparts are combined to make devices; devices are built into biological systems. Computers are used at all stages of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle, from mathematical modelling through to the use of robots for the automation of assembly and experimentation. Synthetic biology applies engineering principles of standardisation, modularity, and abstraction, enabling fast prototyping and the ready exchange of designs between synthetic biologists working around the world. Like toy building blocks, compatible modular designs enable bioparts to be combined and optimised easily; biopart specifications are shared in open registries. Synthetic biology is made possible due to major advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis technologies, and through knowledge gleaned in the field of systems biology. Systems biology aims to understand biology across scales, from the molecular and cellular, up to tissues and organisms, and describes cells as complex information-processing systems. By contrast, synthetic biology seeks to design and build its own systems. Applications of synthetic biology are wide-ranging but include impacting healthcare to improve diagnosis and make better treatments for disease; it seeks to improve the environment by finding novel ways to clean up pollution, make industrial processes for chemical synthesis sustainable, and remove the need for damaging farming practices by making better fertilisers.

      "abstract": "The long road from emerging biotechnologies to commercial \"green\" biosynthetic routes for chemical production relies in part on efficient microbial use of sustainable and renewable waste biomass feedstocks. One solution is to apply the consolidated bioprocessing approach, whereby microorganisms convert lignocellulose waste into advanced fuels and other chemicals. As lignocellulose is a highly complex network of polymers, enzymatic degradation or \"saccharification\" requires a range of cellulolytic enzymes acting synergistically to release the abundant sugars contained within. Complications arise from the need for extracellular localisation of cellulolytic enzymes, whether they be free or cell-associated. This review highlights the current progress in the consolidated bioprocessing approach, whereby microbial chassis are engineered to grow on lignocellulose as sole carbon sources whilst generating commercially useful chemicals. Future perspectives in the emerging biofoundry approach with bacterial hosts are discussed, where solutions to existing bottlenecks could potentially be overcome though the application of high throughput and iterative Design-Build-Test-Learn methodologies. These rapid automated pathway building infrastructures could be adapted for addressing the challenges of increasing cellulolytic capabilities of microorganisms to commercially viable levels.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nSynthetic biology research and technology translation has garnered increasing interest from the governments and private investors in Asia, where the technology has great potential in driving a sustainable bio-based economy. This Perspective reviews the latest developments in the key enabling technologies of synthetic biology and its application in bio-manufacturing, medicine, food and agriculture in Asia. Asia-centric strengths in synthetic biology to grow the bio-based economy, such as advances in genome editing and the presence of biofoundries combined with the availability of natural resources and vast markets, are also highlighted. The potential barriers to the sustainable development of the field, including inadequate infrastructure and policies, with suggestions to overcome these by building public-private partnerships, more effective multi-lateral collaborations and well-developed governance framework, are presented. Finally, the roles of technology, education and regulation in mitigating potential biosecurity risks are examined. Through these discussions, stakeholders from different groups, including academia, industry and government, are expectantly better positioned to contribute towards the establishment of innovation and bio-economy hubs in Asia.",

They convert lignocellulosic substrates to soluble sugars and help in the biodegradation process. Various biocomputational tools can be utilized to understand the catalytic activity, reaction kinetics, complexity of active sites, and chemical behavior of enzyme complexes in reactions. This might be helpful in increasing productivity and cost reduction in industries. The present review gives an overview of some interesting aspects of enzyme design, including computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulation, homology modeling, mutational analysis, etc., toward enhancing the quality of these enzymes. Moreover, the review also covers the aspects of synthetic biology, which could be helpful in faster and reliable development of useful enzymes with desired characteristics and applications.

      "abstract": "A grand challenge facing society is climate change caused mainly by rising CO2 concentration in Earth's atmosphere. Terrestrial plants are linchpins in global carbon cycling, with a unique capability of capturing CO2 via photosynthesis and translocating captured carbon to stems, roots, and soils for long-term storage. However, many researchers postulate that existing land plants cannot meet the ambitious requirement for CO2 removal to mitigate climate change in the future due to low photosynthetic efficiency, limited carbon allocation for long-term storage, and low suitability for the bioeconomy. To address these limitations, there is an urgent need for genetic improvement of existing plants or construction of novel plant systems through biosystems design (or biodesign). Here, we summarize validated biological parts (e.g., protein-encoding genes and noncoding RNAs) for biological engineering of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) traits in terrestrial plants to accelerate land-based decarbonization in bioenergy plantations and agricultural settings and promote a vibrant bioeconomy. Specifically, we first summarize the framework of plant-based CDR (e.g., CO2 capture, translocation, storage, and conversion to value-added products). Then, we highlight some representative biological parts, with experimental evidence, in this framework. Finally, we discuss challenges and strategies for the identification and curation of biological parts for CDR engineering in plants.",

This study is focused on the search for new loci associated with meat productivity and carcass traits in sheep. With a multivariate approach applied to publicly available GWAS results, we identified eight novel loci associated with the meat productivity and carcass traits in sheep. Using an in silico follow-up approach, we prioritized 13 genes in these loci. One of eight novel loci near the FAM3C and WNT16 genes has been replicated in an independent sample of Russian sheep populations (N = 108). The novel loci were added to our regularly updated database increasing the number of known loci to more than 140.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nEngineered plasmids are widely used in the biological sciences. Since many plasmids contain DNA sequences that have been reused and remixed by researchers for decades, annotation of their functional elements is often incomplete. Missing information about the presence, location, or precise identity of a plasmid feature can lead to unintended consequences or failed experiments. Many engineered plasmids contain sequences:such as recombinant DNA from all domains of life, wholly synthetic DNA sequences, and engineered gene expression elements:that are not predicted by microbial genome annotation pipelines. Existing plasmid annotation tools have limited feature libraries and do not detect incomplete fragments of features that are present in many plasmids for historical reasons and may impact their newly designed functions. We created the open source pLannotate web server so users can quickly and comprehensively annotate plasmid features. pLannotate is powered by large databases of genetic parts and proteins. It employs a filtering algorithm to display only the most relevant feature matches and also reports feature fragments. Finally, pLannotate displays a graphical map of the annotated plasmid, explains the provenance of each feature prediction, and allows results to be downloaded in a variety of formats. The webserver for pLannotate is accessible at: http://plannotate.barricklab.org/\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\npLannotate is a web server for annotating engineered plasmids.

      "abstract": "Jatropha L. species, in particular, J. curcas and J. gossypiifolia, are well known medicinal plants used for treating various diseases. In the present study, leaf and stem bark extracts of J. curcas and J. gossypiifolia obtained by maceration or homogenizer assisted extraction, were investigated for their phytochemical contents and biological potential as antioxidants, enzyme inhibitors and neuromodulators. In this regard, the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was investigated in hypothalamic HypoE22 cells. Finally, a bioinformatics analysis was carried out with the aim to unravel the putative mechanisms consistent with both metabolomic fingerprints and pharmacological effects. The leaf extracts of J. curcas showed higher total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) than the stem bark extracts (range: 5.79-48.95 mg GAE/g and 1.64-13.99 mg RE/g, respectively), while J. gossypiifolia possessed TPC and TFC in the range of 42.62-62.83 mg GAE/g and 6.97-17.63 mg RE/g, respectively. HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the leaf extracts of both species obtained by homogenizer assisted extraction are richer in phytochemical compounds compared to the stem bark extracts obtained by the same extraction method. In vitro antioxidant potentials were also demonstrated in different assays (DPPH: 6.89-193.93 mg TE/g, ABTS: 20.20-255.39 mg TE/g, CUPRAC: 21.07-333.30 mg TE/g, FRAP: 14.02-168.93 mg TE/g, metal chelating activity: 3.21-17.51 mg EDTAE/g and phosphomolybdenum assay: 1.76-3.55 mmol TE/g). In particular, the leaf extract of J. curcas and the stem bark extract of J. gossypiifolia, both obtained by homogenizer assisted extraction, showed the most potent antioxidant capacity in terms of free radical scavenging and reducing activity, which could be related to their higher TPC and TFC. Furthermore, anti-neurodegenerative (acetylcholinesterase inhibition: 1.12-2.36 mg GALAE/g; butyrylcholinetserase inhibition: 0.50-3.68 mg GALAE/g), anti-hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase inhibition: 38.14-57.59 mg KAE/g) and antidiabetic (amylase inhibition: 0.28-0.62 mmol ACAE/g; glucosidase inhibition: 0.65-0.81 mmol ACAE/g) properties were displayed differentially by the different extracts. Additionally, the extracts were effective in reducing the gene expression of both TNFalpha and BDNF, which could be partially mediated by phenolic compounds such as naringenin, apigenin and quercetin. Indeed, the scientific data obtained from the present study complement the several other reports highlighting the pharmacological potentials of these two species, thus supporting their uses as therapeutically active plants.",

It is a complex disability, associated with challenges in cognitive, behavioural and socialemotional functioning, as well as an increased risk of physical and mental health comorbidities, and difficulties in daily living across the lifespan. Previous attempts to characterise the profile of this population have been hampered by differences in data collected across studies, regional discrepancies in terminology and definitions, and a lack of tools to integrate comprehensive datasets.\n\nMethods and analysis\n\nThe goals of this study are to use the Canadian National FASD Database, a national repository of FASD assessment-related information, to better understand the functional profile, comorbidities, intervention needs and difficulties in daily living experienced by individuals assessed for FASD across the lifespan. We will also examine what factors may be the most sensitive predictors of receiving an FASD diagnosis. Data will be analysed from over 3500 records collected between 2010 and 2021 (ongoing) from 26 FASD diagnostic clinics in seven provinces and territories. Data collection is ongoing, and analysis will be performed on a biannual basis to continue to hone our understanding of the profiles, needs and outcomes of individuals assessed for FASD in Canada. This research is critical for refining FASD assessment and diagnostic practice, enabling accurate and early identification of individuals with FASD, and connecting individuals with FASD and their families to comprehensive and effective services and resources to support healthy developmental trajectories.\n\nEthics and dissemination\n\nEthics approval for the National FASD Database Project was obtained from the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board. As new knowledge is gained from this project, findings will be disseminated through publications, presentations and feedback to participating clinics, with the ultimate goal of informing FASD research, practice and policy.",

Logical regulatory networks can be used to predict biological and cellular behaviors by system perturbations and in silico simulations. Today, broad sets of causal interactions are available in a variety of biological knowledge resources. However, different visions, based on distinct biological interests, have led to the development of multiple ways to describe and annotate causal molecular interactions. It can therefore be challenging to efficiently explore various resources of causal interaction and maintain an overview of recorded contextual information that ensures valid use of the data. This review lists the different types of public resources with causal interactions, the different views on biological processes that they represent, the various data formats they use for data representation and storage, and the data exchange and conversion procedures that are available to extract and download these interactions. This may further raise awareness among the targeted audience, i.e. logical modelers and other scientists interested in molecular causal interactions, but also database managers and curators, about the abundance and variety of causal molecular interaction data, and the variety of tools and approaches to convert them into one interoperable resource.",

      "abstract": "Luteolin, a natural flavone compound, exists in a variety of fruits and vegetables, and its anticancer effect has been shown in many studies. However, its use in glioma treatment is hampered due to the fact that the underlying mechanism of action has not been fully explored. Therefore, we elucidated the potential antiglioma targets and pathways of luteolin systematically with the help of network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The druggability of luteolin, including absorption, excretion, distribution, and metabolism, was assessed via the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The potential targets of luteolin and glioma were extracted from public databases, and the intersecting targets between luteolin and glioma were integrated and visualized by a Venn diagram. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway analysis was engaged in Metascape. The network of the luteolin-target-pathway was visualized by Cytoscape. Ultimately, the interactions between luteolin and predicted key targets were confirmed by Discovery studio software. According to the ADME results, luteolin shows great potential for development into a drug. 4860 glioma-associated targets and 280 targets of luteolin were identified, of which 205 were intersection targets. 6 core targets of luteolin against glioma, including AKT1, JUN, ALB, MAPK3, MAPK1, and TNF, were identified via PPI network analysis of which AKT1, JUN, ALB, MAPK1, and TNF harbor diagnostic value. The biological processes of luteolin are mainly involved in the response to inorganic substances, response to oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling pathway. The essential pathways of luteolin against glioma involve pathways in cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, and more. Meanwhile, luteolin's interaction with six core targets was verified by molecular docking simulation and its antiglioma effect was verified by in vitro experiments. This study suggests that luteolin has a promising potential for development into a drug and, moreover, it displays preventive effects against glioma by targeting various genes and pathways.",

Overlapping genes were annotated by gene ontology (GO) function and enriched by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway. The cluster-1 genes obtained by Cytoscape were analyzed by GEPIA for expression and overall survival in HCC and, finally, introduced target genes to DGIdb to get associated drugs. A total of 199 genes were found to be in common between HCC and depression. GO term enrichment analysis on DAVID found the top-6 biological processes to be mainly associated with cell death and apoptosis. The top-6 cellular component terms are extracellular. The top-6 of molecular function terms are mainly associated with receptor binding. The top-6 pathways enriched by KEGG are mainly related to inflammatory response. IGF1, VEGFA, and SERPINE1 had statistical differences in expression and 10-year survival rate. There are total 45 drugs that act on VEGFA and SERPINE1.

Univariate analysis was utilized to identify IRGs that related to overall survival. Whereafter, a multigene signature in the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort was established based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis.

An immune-based prognostic model was developed, which contained eight IRGs. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the risk score model was an independent prognostic indicator in PAAD (HR > 1, P < 0.001). Besides, the sensitivity of the model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

However, the potential molecular biological process underpinning the occurrence and development of HCC is still largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the core genes related to HCC and explore their potential molecular events using bioinformatics methods. HCC-related expression profiles GSE25097 and GSE84005 were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 306 HCC tissues and 281 corresponding noncancerous tissues were identified using GEO2R online tools. The protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) was constructed and visualized using the STRING database. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs were carried out using DAVID 6.8 and KOBAS 3.0. Additionally, module analysis and centrality parameter analysis were performed by Cytoscape. The expression differences of key genes in normal hepatocyte cells and HCC cells were verified by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, survival analysis of key genes was performed by GEPIA. Our results showed that a total of 291 DEGs were identified including 99 upregulated genes and 192 downregulated genes. Our results showed that the PPIN of HCC was made up of 287 nodes and 2527 edges. GO analysis showed that these genes were mainly enriched in the molecular function of protein binding. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis also revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in the metabolic, cell cycle, and chemical carcinogenesis pathways. Interestingly, a significant module with high centrality features including 10 key genes was found. Among these, CDK1, NDC80, HMMR, CDKN3, and PTTG1, which were only upregulated in HCC patients, have attracted much attention. Furthermore, qRT-PCR also confirmed the upregulation of these five key genes in the normal human hepatocyte cell line (HL-7702) and HCC cell lines (SMMC-7721, MHCC-97L, and MHCC-97H); patients with upregulated expression of these five key genes had significantly poorer survival and prognosis. CDK1, NDC80, HMMR, CDKN3, and PTTG1 can be used as molecular markers for HCC.

      "abstract": "Background\n\nStudies have shown that the Sec61 gamma subunit (SEC61G) is overexpressed in several tumors and could serve as a potential prognostic marker. However, the correlation between SEC61G and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In the current study, we aimed to demonstrate the prognostic value and potential biological function of the SEC61G gene in LUAD.\n\nMethods\n\nPublic datasets were used for SEC61G expression analyses. The prognostic value of SEC61G in LUAD was investigated using the Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox analyses. The correlation between the methylation level of SEC61G and its mRNA expression was evaluated via cBioPortal. Additionally, MethSurv was used to determine the prognostic value of the SEC61G methylation levels in LUAD. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the potential mechanism of SEC61G. Also, single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) and TIMER online tool were applied to identify the correlation between SEC61G and immune filtration. Furthermore, cell functional experiments were conducted to verify the biological behavior of SEC61G in lung adenocarcinoma cells (LAC).\n\nResults\n\nSEC61G was upregulated in pan-cancers, including LUAD. High SEC61G expression was significantly correlated with worse prognosis in LUAD patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high SEC61G expression was an independent prognostic factor in the TCGA cohort. (HR = 1.760 95% CI: 1.297-2.388, p < 0.001). The methylation level of SEC61G negatively correlated with the SEC61G expression (R = - 0.290, p < 0.001), and patients with low SEC61G methylation had worse overall survival. (p = 0.0014). Proliferation-associated terms such as cell cycle and cell division were significantly enriched in GO and KEGG analysis. Vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown of SEC61G resulted in decreased cell proliferation, invasion and facilitated apoptosis in LAC. GSEA analysis found that SEC61G expression was associated with the E2F targets. Moreover, SEC61G expression was negatively correlated with the immune cell infiltration including CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cell.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study indicated that overexpression of SEC61G was significantly associated with poor prognosis of LUAD patients and the malignant phenotypes of LUAD cells, suggesting that it could be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target of LUAD.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-021-08957-4.",

With the rapid development of DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics, a large number of putative biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported. However, only a limited number of natural products have been discovered, as most biosynthetic gene clusters are not expressed or are expressed at extremely low levels under conventional laboratory conditions. With the rapid development of synthetic biology, advanced genome mining and engineering strategies have been reported and they provide new opportunities for discovery of natural products. This review discusses advances in recent years that can accelerate the design, build, test, and learn (DBTL) cycle of natural product discovery, and prospects trends and key challenges for future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The hydroalcoholic extract (MIT) of Micromeria imbricata (Forssk.) growing in Saudi Arabia in addition to the chloroform (MIC) and n-butanol (MIB) fractions were investigated for the first time using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The analysis revealed the tentative identification of fifty-eight compounds including three organic acids, twenty-five phenolic compounds, three coumarins, two anthocyanins, twenty-one flavonoids, three terpenes, and one miscellaneous. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of M. imbricata (MIT) and its fractions (MIC and MIB) were determined by in vitro evaluation of their cytotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-obesity characteristics. The MIT extract showed the highest phenolic (125.23 +- 0.87 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 gm extract) and flavonoid (112.24 +- 2.45 mg quercetin equivalent/100 gm extract) contents followed by n-butanol and chloroform fractions. The MIT extract revealed a potent cytotoxic activity against HepG-2 (Hepatocellular carcinoma) and MCF-7 (Breast carcinoma) with IC50 28.5 +- 2.0 and 35.2 +- 1.2 microg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the tested hydroalcoholic extract exhibited a significant DPPH scavenging activity with SC50 28.4 +- 1.2 microg/mL and a remarkable lipase inhibitory activity with IC50 54.2 +- 1.2 microg/mL. In conclusion, the current study presents the first insights into the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological properties of M. imbricata extract and its chloroform and n-butanol fractions. The results revealed that M. imbricata hydroalcoholic extract might be a prolific source of bioactive constituents with potent antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-obesity potential. It might be a natural alternative therapy and nutritional strategy for obesity treatment.",

To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive National Cancer Institute Thesaurus cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.\n\n Database URL: progenetix.org",

Interest in natural products in drug discovery is documented in an increasing number of publications of bioactive secondary metabolites. Among those, medicinal plants are one of the most studied for this endeavor. An ever thriving area of opportunity within the field concerns the discovery of antidiabetic natural products. As a result, a vast amount of secondary metabolites are isolated from medicinal plants used against diabetes mellitus but whose information has not been organized systematically yet. Several research articles enumerate antidiabetic compounds, but the lack of a chemical database for antidiabetic metabolites limits their application in drug development. In this work, we present DiaNat-DB, a comprehensive collection of 336 molecules from medicinal plants reported to have in vitro or in vivo antidiabetic activity. We also discuss a chemoinformatic analysis of DiaNat-DB to compare antidiabetic drugs and natural product databases. To further explore the antidiabetic chemical space based on DiaNat compounds, we searched for analogs in ZINC15, an extensive database listing commercially available compounds. This work will help future analyses, design, and development of new antidiabetic drugs. DiaNat-DB and its ZINC15 analogs are freely available at .\n\nMedicinal plants are widely used against diabetes mellitus.

      "abstract": "High-quality dermatology patient registries often require considerable time to develop and produce meaningful data. Development time is influenced by registry complexity and regulatory hurdles that vary significantly nationally and institutionally. The rapid emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has challenged health services in an unprecedented manner. Mobilization of the dermatology community in response has included rapid development and deployment of multiple, partially harmonized, international patient registries, reinventing established patient registry timelines. Partnership with patient organizations has demonstrated the critical nature of inclusive patient involvement. This global effort has demonstrated the value, capacity, and necessity for the dermatology community to adopt a more cohesive approach to patient registry development and data sharing that can lead to myriad benefits. These include improved utilization of limited resources, increased data interoperability, improved ability to rapidly collect meaningful data, and shortened response times to generate real-world evidence. We call on the global dermatology community to support the development of an international federation of patient registries to consolidate and operationalize the lessons learned during this pandemic.

With increasing volumes, complexity and the need to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, phenomic and environmental data, community databases face tremendous challenges in ongoing maintenance, expansion and upgrades. A common infrastructure framework using community standards shared by many databases can reduce development burden, provide interoperability, ensure use of common standards and support long-term sustainability. Tripal is a mature, open source platform built to meet this need. With ongoing improvement since its first release in 2009, Tripal provides full functionality for searching, browsing, loading and curating numerous types of data and is a primary technology powering at least 31 publicly available databases spanning plants, animals and human data, primarily storing genomics, genetics and breeding data. Tripal software development is managed by a shared, inclusive governance structure including both project management and advisory teams.

However, climate change is expected to affect the species composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition hotspots.\n\nBaumbach et al. investigate impacts of climate change on tree species within tropical forest ecosystems in Central America.

However, many pathways obtained by GBA are biologically impossible, making it difficult to study how the global structures affect the biological functions of a network. New method that can calculate the biologically relevant pathways is desirable for structural analysis of metabolic networks.\n\nResults\n\nHere, we present a new method to determine the bow-tie connectivity structure by calculating possible pathways between any pairs of metabolites in the metabolic network using a flux balance analysis (FBA) approach to ensure that the obtained pathways are biologically relevant. We tested this method with 15 selected high-quality genome-scale metabolic models from BiGG database. The results confirmed the key roles of central metabolites in network connectivity, locating in the core part of the bow-tie structure, the giant strongly connected component (GSC). However, the sizes of GSCs revealed by GBA are significantly larger than those by FBA approach. A great number of metabolites in the GSC from GBA actually cannot be produced from or converted to other metabolites through a mass balanced pathway and thus should not be in GSC but in other subsets of the bow-tie structure. In contrast, the bow-tie structural classification of metabolites obtained by FBA is more biologically relevant and suitable for the study of the structure-function relationships of genome scale metabolic networks.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe FBA based pathway calculation improve the biologically relevant classification of metabolites in the bow-tie connectivity structure of the metabolic network, taking us one step further toward understanding how such system-level structures impact the biological functions of an organism.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12866-021-02357-1.",

Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene-gene and protein-protein interactions in TRN and PPI, respectively, also non-randomly overlap. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. Robustness of the TRN-PPI multiplex is dependent on this coupling. Functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those interacting with pathogen proteins, are preferentially situated in important parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions.

The source code is based on open-source tools and is organized as a Python package. Tasks can be executed individually or within the context of scalable, robust workflows. First, structures are standardized and duplicate entries are filtered out. Then, molecules are probed for the presence of predefined fragments. For molecules with more than one match, fragment combinations are classified. The algorithm considers the pairwise relative position of fragments within the molecule (fused atoms, linkers, intermediary rings), resulting in 18 different possible fragment combination categories. Finally, all combinations for a given molecule are assembled into a fragment combination graph, with fragments as nodes and combination types as edges. This workflow was applied to characterize PNPs in the ChEMBL database via comparison of fragment combination graphs with natural product (NP) references, represented by the Dictionary of Natural Products. The Murcko fragments extracted from 2000 structures previously described were used to define NP fragments. The results indicate that ca. 23% of the biologically relevant compounds listed in ChEMBL comply to the PNP definition and that, therefore, PNPs occur frequently among known biologically relevant small molecules. The majority (>95%) of PNPs contain two to four fragments, mainly (>95%) distributed in five different combination types. These findings may provide guidance for the design of new PNPs.",

The program allows a user to retrieve organism-centred data and assemble them in a single data warehouse which constitutes a useful resource for several biological applications.

The database contents resulted from a manual literature search that yielded over 8,500 citations, but only a small fraction of these publications were used in the final database. Manually curating a database is time-consuming and requires domain expertise to gather relevant data scattered throughout millions of articles. This work proposes a supervised machine learning pipeline to assist the manual literature retrieval process.\n\nMethods: The manually retrieved corpus of scientific publications used in the Exposome-Explorer was used as training and testing sets for the machine learning models (classifiers). Several parameters and algorithms were evaluated to predict an article's relevance based on different datasets made of titles, abstracts and metadata.\n\nResults: The top performance classifier was built with the Logistic Regression algorithm using the title and abstract set, achieving an F2-score of 70.1%. Furthermore, we extracted 1,143 entities from these articles with a classifier trained for biomarker entity recognition. Of these, we manually validated 45 new candidate entries to the database.\n\nConclusion: Our methodology reduced the number of articles to be manually screened by the database curators by nearly 90%, while only misclassifying 22.1% of the relevant articles. We expect that this methodology can also be applied to similar biomarkers datasets or be adapted to assist the manual curation process of similar chemical or disease databases.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the binding affinity of andrographolide and its derivative i.e., 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide with targets related to COVID-19 and their probable role in regulating multiple pathways in COVID-19 infection. SMILES of both compounds were retrieved from the PubChem database and predicted for probably regulated proteins. The predicted proteins were queried in STRING to evaluate the protein-protein interaction, and modulated pathways were identified concerning the KEGG database. Drug-likeness and ADMET profile of each compound was evaluated using MolSoft and admetSAR 2.0, respectively. Molecular docking was carried using Autodock 4.0. Andrographolide and its derivative were predicted to have a high binding affinity with papain-like protease, coronavirus main proteinase, and spike protein. Molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed for each complex which suggested the strong binding affinities of both compounds with targets. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that both compounds modulated the immune system by regulating chemokine signaling, Rap1 signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling, NF-kappa B signaling, RAS signaling, p53 signaling, HIF-1 signaling, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The study suggests strong interaction of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide against COVID-19 associated target proteins and exhibited different immunoregulatory pathways.\n\nThe present study aimed to investigate the binding affinity of andrographolide and its derivative i.e. 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide with targets related to COVID-19 and their probable role in regulating multiple pathways in COVID-19 infection.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMetagenomics became a standard strategy to comprehend the functional potential of microbial communities, including the human microbiome. Currently, the number of metagenomes in public repositories is increasing exponentially. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the MG-RAST are the two main repositories for metagenomic data. These databases allow scientists to reanalyze samples and explore new hypotheses. However, mining samples from them can be a limiting factor, since the metadata available in these repositories is often misannotated, misleading, and decentralized, creating an overly complex environment for sample reanalysis. The main goal of the HumanMetagenomeDB is to simplify the identification and use of public human metagenomes of interest. HumanMetagenomeDB version 1.0 contains metadata of 69 822 metagenomes. We standardized 203 attributes, based on standardized ontologies, describing host characteristics (e.g. sex, age and body mass index), diagnosis information (e.g. cancer, Crohn's disease and Parkinson), location (e.g. country, longitude and latitude), sampling site (e.g. gut, lung and skin) and sequencing attributes (e.g. sequencing platform, average length and sequence quality). Further, HumanMetagenomeDB version 1.0 metagenomes encompass 58 countries, 9 main sample sites (i.e. body parts), 58 diagnoses and multiple ages, ranging from just born to 91 years old.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nScreening for potential cancer therapies using existing large datasets of drug perturbations requires expertise and resources not available to all. This is often a barrier for lab scientists to tap into these valuable resources. To address these issues, one can take advantage of prior knowledge especially those coded in standard formats such as causal biological networks (CBN). Large datasets can be converted into appropriate structures, analyzed once and the results made freely available in easy-to-use formats. We used the Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures to model the cell-specific effect of hundreds of drug treatments on gene expression. These signatures were then used to predict the effect of the treatments on several CBN using the network perturbation amplitudes analysis. We packaged the pre-computed scores in a database with an interactive web interface. The intuitive user-friendly interface can be used to query the database for drug perturbations and quantify their effect on multiple key biological functions in cancer cell lines. In addition to describing the process of building the database and the interface, we provide a realistic use case to explain how to use and interpret the results. To sum, we pre-computed cancer-cell-specific perturbation amplitudes of several biological networks and made the output available in a database with an interactive web interface.\n\nDatabase URL https://mahshaaban.shinyapps.io/LINPSAPP/",

Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data:mainly from literature:requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.\n\n Database URL: https://apicuron.org",

All BioGRID content is curated from primary experimental evidence in the biomedical literature, and includes both focused low-throughput studies and large high-throughput datasets. BioGRID also captures protein post-translational modifications and protein or gene interactions with bioactive small molecules including many known drugs. A built-in network visualization tool combines all annotations and allows users to generate network graphs of protein, genetic and chemical interactions. In addition to general curation across species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in specific aspects of cellular regulation, for example the ubiquitin-proteasome system, as well as specific disease areas, such as for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome. A recent extension of BioGRID, named the Open Repository of CRISPR Screens (ORCS, orcs.thebiogrid.org), captures single mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions from published high throughput genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens.

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are a structurally diverse class of natural products that have been found to have a range of beneficial activities in humans. However, the clinical utilisation of these molecules has been limited due to their low solubility, chemical stability, bioavailability and extensive intestinal metabolism in vivo. Recently, the view has been formed that site-specific modification of flavonoids by methylation and/or glycosylation, processes that occur in plants endogenously, can be used to improve and adapt their biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties. The traditional source of flavonoids and their modified forms is from plants and is limited due to the low amounts present in biomass, intrinsic to the nature of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Access to greater amounts of flavonoids, and understanding of the impact of modifications, requires a rethink in terms of production, more specifically towards the adoption of plant biosynthetic pathways into ex planta synthesis approaches. Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, aided by protein engineering and machine learning methods, offer attractive and exciting avenues for ex planta flavonoid synthesis. This review seeks to explore the applications of synthetic biology towards the ex planta biosynthesis of flavonoids, and how the natural plant methylation and glycosylation pathways can be harnessed to produce modified flavonoids with more favourable biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties for clinical use. It is envisaged that the development of viable alternative production systems for the synthesis of flavonoids and their methylated and glycosylated forms will help facilitate their greater clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nWaterborne contaminants were monitored in 69 tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes in 2010 and 2014 using semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). A risk-based screening approach was used to prioritize chemicals and chemical mixtures, identify sites at greatest risk for biological impacts, and identify potential hazards to monitor at those sites. Analyses included 185 chemicals (143 detected) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), legacy and current-use pesticides, fire retardants, pharmaceuticals, and fragrances. Hazard quotients were calculated by dividing detected concentrations by biological effect concentrations reported in the ECOTOX Knowledgebase (toxicity quotients) or ToxCast database (exposure-activity ratios [EARs]). Mixture effects were estimated by summation of EAR values for chemicals that influence ToxCast assays with common gene targets. Nineteen chemicals:atrazine, N,N-diethyltoluamide, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, dl-menthol, galaxolide, p-tert-octylphenol, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 3 PAHs, 4 pharmaceuticals, and 3 phosphate flame retardants:had toxicity quotients >0.1 or EARs for individual chemicals >10-3 at 10% or more of the sites monitored. An additional 4 chemicals (tributyl phosphate, triethyl citrate, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene) were present in mixtures with EARs >10-3. To evaluate potential apical effects and biological endpoints to monitor in exposed wildlife, in vitro bioactivity data were compared to adverse outcome pathway gene ontology information. Endpoints and effects associated with endocrine disruption, alterations in xenobiotic metabolism, and potentially neuronal development would be relevant to monitor at the priority sites. The EAR threshold exceedance for many chemical classes was correlated with urban land cover and wastewater effluent influence, whereas herbicides and fire retardants were also correlated to agricultural land cover.

      "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF), together with well-defined ontologies, significantly increases data interoperability and usability. The SPARQL query language was introduced to retrieve requested RDF data and to explore links between them. Among other useful features, SPARQL supports federated queries that combine multiple independent data source endpoints. This allows users to obtain insights that are not possible using only a single data source. Owing to all of these useful features, many biological and chemical databases present their data in RDF, and support SPARQL querying. In our project, we primary focused on PubChem, ChEMBL and ChEBI small-molecule datasets. These datasets are already being exported to RDF by their creators. However, none of them has an official and currently supported SPARQL endpoint. This omission makes it difficult to construct complex or federated queries that could access all of the datasets, thus underutilising the main advantage of the availability of RDF data. Our goal is to address this gap by integrating the datasets into one database called the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that will be accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. Beyond that, we will also focus on increasing mutual interoperability of the datasets. To realise the endpoint, we decided to implement an in-house developed SPARQL engine based on the PostgreSQL relational database for data storage. In our approach, data are stored in the traditional relational form, and the SPARQL engine translates incoming SPARQL queries into equivalent SQL queries. An important feature of the engine is that it optimises the resulting SQL queries. Together with optimisations performed by PostgreSQL, this allows efficient evaluations of SPARQL queries. The endpoint provides not only querying in the dataset, but also the compound substructure and similarity search supported by our Sachem project. Although the endpoint is accessible from an internet browser, it is mainly intended to be used for programmatic access by other services, for example as a part of federated queries. For regular users, we offer a rich web application called ChemWebRDF using the endpoint. The application is publicly available at https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/chemweb/.",

This review, therefore, provides a comprehensive update of the available information on the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-HIV, anti-malarial, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-tyrosinase, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activities of selected Helichrysum species of interest: H. petiolare, H. cymocum, H. foetidum, and H. pandurifolium Schrank, using scientific databases as well as electronic and print sources. The ethnobotanical and morphological characteristics as well as the phytochemical composition and biological activities of these plants are elucidated. The scientific rationale for their current use is discussed based on the evidence in the literature. This review highlights the putative use of the Helichrysum species as a reliable source of bioactive compounds for the production of standard commercial drugs to treat many ailments, including those reported in folkloric uses.

      "abstract": "Eye irritation and corrosion are fundamental considerations in developing chemicals to be used in or near the eye, from cleaning products to ophthalmic solutions. Unfortunately, animal testing is currently the standard method to identify compounds that cause eye irritation or corrosion. Yet, there is growing pressure on the part of regulatory agencies both in the USA and abroad to develop New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that help reduce the need for animal testing and address unmet need to modernize safety evaluation of chemical hazards. In furthering the development and applications of computational NAMs in chemical safety assessment, in this study we have collected the largest expertly curated dataset of compounds tested for eye irritation and corrosion, and employed this data to build and validate binary and multi-classification Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models that can reliably assess eye irritation/corrosion potential of novel untested compounds. QSAR models were generated with Random Forest (RF) and Multi-Descriptor Read Across (MuDRA) machine learning (ML) methods, and validated using a 5-fold external cross-validation protocol. These models demonstrated high balanced accuracy (CCR of 0.68-0.88), sensitivity (SE of 0.61-0.84), positive predictive value (PPV of 0.65-0.90), specificity (SP of 0.56-0.91), and negative predictive value (NPV of 0.68-0.85). Overall, MuDRA models outperformed RF models and were applied to predict compounds' irritation/corrosion potential from the Inactive Ingredient Database, which contains components present in FDA-approved drug products, and from the Cosmetic Ingredient Database, the European Commission source of information on cosmetic substances. All models built and validated in this study are publicly available at the STopTox web portal (https://stoptox.mml.unc.edu/).

Here, we introduce the novel ROCOCO Performance Scoring System (RPSS) translating dose differences into clinically relevant endpoints and apply this to a treatment plan comparison of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in 20 pilocytic astrocytoma patients.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe RPSS was developed on the basis of expert-based weighting factors and toxicity scores per OAR. The imaging datasets of 20 pilocytic astrocytoma patients having undergone radiotherapy were included in this in silico dosimetric comparison trial as proof of principle. For each of these patients, treatment plans to a total dose of 54 Gy (RBE) were generated for VMAT and IMPT and these were compared regarding radiation dose to the clinical target volume (CTV) and OARs. The RPSS was calculated for each treatment plan comparing VMAT and IMPT.\n\nResults\n\nIn 40 analysed treatment plans, the average and low dose volumes to various OARs were significantly reduced when using IMPT compared to VMAT (p < 0.05). Using the RPSS, a significant difference between both treatment modalities was found, with 85% of the patients having a lower RPSS in favour of the IMPT plan.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are dosimetric differences between IMPT and VMAT in pilocytic astrocytoma patients. In absence of clinically validated NTCP models we introduce the RPSS model in order to objectively compare treatment modalities by translating dosimetric differences in potential clinical differences.",

      "abstract": "There are several indirect database searching approaches to identify the potential source of a forensic biological sample. These DNA-based approaches are familial searching, Y-STR database searching, and investigative genetic genealogy (IGG). The first two strategies use forensic DNA databases managed by the government, and the latter uses databases managed by private citizens or companies. Each of these search strategies relies on DNA testing to identify relatives of the donor of the crime scene sample, provided such profiles reside in the DNA database(s). All three approaches have been successfully used to identify the donor of biological evidence, which assisted in solving criminal cases or identifying unknown human remains. This paper describes and compares these approaches in terms of genotyping technologies, searching methods, database structures, searching efficiency, data quality, data security, and costs, and raises some potential privacy and legal considerations for further discussion by stakeholders and scientists. Y-STR database searching and IGG are advantageous since they are able to assist in more cases than familial searching readily identifying distant relatives. In contrast, familial searching can be performed more readily with existing laboratory systems. Every country or state may have its own unique economic, technical, cultural, and legal considerations and should decide the best approach(es) to fit those circumstances. Regardless of the approach, the ultimate goal should be the same: generate investigative leads and solve active and cold criminal cases to public safety, under stringent policies and security practices designed to protect the privacy of its citizenry.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as an integral part of the smart health monitoring system in the present world. The smart health monitoring deals with not only for emergency and hospital services but also for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The industry 5.0 and 5/6G has allowed the development of cost-efficient sensors and devices which can collect a wide range of human biological data and transfer it through wireless network communication in real time. This led to real-time monitoring of patient data through multiple IoMT devices from remote locations. The IoMT network registers a large number of patients and devices every day, along with the generation of huge amount of big data or health data. This patient data should retain data privacy and data security on the IoMT network to avoid any misuse. To attain such data security and privacy of the patient and IoMT devices, a three-level/tier network integrated with blockchain and interplanetary file system (IPFS) has been proposed. The proposed network is making the best use of IPFS and blockchain technology for security and data exchange in a three-level healthcare network. The present framework has been evaluated for various network activities for validating the scalability of the network. The network was found to be efficient in handling complex data with the capability of scalability.",

      "title": "A systematic review of security and privacy issues in the internet of medical things; the role of machine learning approaches",
      "abstract": "Background\n\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is gradually replacing the traditional healthcare system. However, little attention has been paid to their security requirements in the development of the IoMT devices and systems. One of the main reasons can be the difficulty of tuning conventional security solutions to the IoMT system. Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully employed in the attack detection and mitigation process. Advanced ML technique can also be a promising approach to address the existing and anticipated IoMT security and privacy issues. However, because of the existing challenges of IoMT system, it is imperative to know how these techniques can be effectively utilized to meet the security and privacy requirements without affecting the IoMT systems quality, services, and device's lifespan.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis article is devoted to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the security and privacy issues of IoMT and their solutions by ML techniques. The recent research papers disseminated between 2010 and 2020 are selected from multiple databases and a standardized SLR method is conducted. A total of 153 papers were reviewed and a critical analysis was conducted on the selected papers. Furthermore, this review study attempts to highlight the limitation of the current methods and aims to find possible solutions to them. Thus, a detailed analysis was carried out on the selected papers through focusing on their methods, advantages, limitations, the utilized tools, and data.\n\nResults\n\nIt was observed that ML techniques have been significantly deployed for device and network layer security. Most of the current studies improved traditional metrics while ignored performance complexity metrics in their evaluations. Their studies environments and utilized data barely represent IoMT system. Therefore, conventional ML techniques may fail if metrics such as resource complexity and power usage are not considered.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of COVID-19 has become more prevalent across the world. It is highly demanding an intelligent strategy to outline the precaution measures until the clinical trials find a successful vaccine. With technological advancement, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has extended its significant role in the development of remote medical point-of-care (RM-PoC). WMSN is generally located on a communication device to sense the vital signaling information that may periodically be transmitted to remote intelligent pouch This modern remote system finds a suitable professional system to inspect the environment condition remotely in order to facilitate the intelligent process. In the past, the RM-PoC has gained more attention for the exploitation of real-time monitoring, treatment follow-up, and action report generation. Even though it has additional advantages in comparison with conventional systems, issues such as security and privacy are seriously considered to protect the modern system information over insecure public networks. Therefore, this study presents a novel Single User Sign-In (SUSI) Mechanism that makes certain of privacy preservation to ensure better protection of multimedia data. It can be achieved over the negotiation of a shared session-key to perform encryption or decryption of sensitive data during the authentication phase. To comply with key agreement properties such as appropriate mutual authentication and secure session key-agreement, a proposed system design is incorporated into the chaotic-map. The above assumption claims that it can not only achieve better security efficiencies but also can moderate the computation, communication, and storage cost of some intelligent systems as compared to elliptic-curve cryptography or RSA. Importantly, in order to offer untraceability and user anonymity, the RM-PoC acquires dynamic identities from proposed SUSI. Moreover, the security efficiencies of proposed SUSI are demonstrated using informal and formal analysis of the real-or-random (RoR) model. Lastly, a simulation study using NS3 is extensively conducted to analyze the communication metrics such as transmission delay, throughput rate, and packet delivery ratio that demonstrates the significance of the proposed SUSI scheme.",

Both are provided in the present meta-analysis and a review as the main signal. One of the basic current challenges in modern biology in the face of new demands in the 21st century is the validation of its paradigms such as the synthetic theory of evolution (STE) and biological species concept (BSC). Another of most valuable goals is the biodiversity assessment for a variety of social needs including free web-based information resources about any living being, renovation of museum collections, nature conservation that recognized as a global project, iBOL, as well as resolving global trading problems such as false labeling of species specimens used as food, drug components, entertainment, etc. The main issues of the review are focused on animals and combine four items.

(3) If we consider sexually reproducing species in marine and terrestrial realms introgressed, as it is still evident in many cases, then we should recognize that the BSC, in view of the complete lack of gene flow among species, is inadequate because many zoological species are not biological ones yet.

Several researchers reported that, a significant mutation in membrane proteins and receptor binding sites of preceding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to turned as novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and disease was named as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients. The lessons learned from the past management of SARS-CoV and other pandemics, have provided some insights to treat COVID-19. Currently, therapies like anti-viral treatment, immunomodulatory agents, plasma transfusion and supportive intervention etc., are using to treat the COVID-19. Few of these were proven to provide significant therapeutic benefits in treating the COVID-19, however no drug is approved by the regulatory agencies. As the fatality rate is high in patients with comorbid conditions, we have also enlightened the current in-line treatment therapies and specific treatment strategies in comorbid conditions to combat the emergence of COVID-19.

The convergence of genome sequencing and computational inference of metabolic networks has enabled great progress toward satisfying that demand by generating metabolic reconstructions from the genomes of thousands of sequenced organisms. Visualization of whole metabolic networks is critical for aiding researchers in understanding, analyzing, and exploiting those reconstructions. We have developed bioinformatics software tools that automatically generate a full metabolic-network diagram for an organism, and that enable searching and analyses of the network. The software generates metabolic-network diagrams for unicellular organisms, for multi-cellular organisms, and for pan-genomes and organism communities. Search tools enable users to find genes, metabolites, enzymes, reactions, and pathways within a diagram. The diagrams are zoomable to enable researchers to study local neighborhoods in detail and to see the big picture. The diagrams also serve as tools for comparison of metabolic networks and for interpreting high-throughput datasets, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and reaction fluxes computed by metabolic models. These data can be overlaid on the metabolic charts to produce animated zoomable displays of metabolic flux and metabolite abundance. The BioCyc.org website contains whole-network diagrams for more than 18,000 sequenced organisms. The ready availability of organism-specific metabolic network diagrams and associated tools for almost any sequenced organism are useful for researchers working to better understand the metabolism of their organism and to interpret high-throughput datasets in a metabolic context.",

Food habits are determined by a wide range of factors, from sensorial stimuli to beliefs and, once commanded by local and seasonal availability, are nowadays driven by marketing campaigns promoting unhealthy and non-sustainable foodstuffs. Top-down and bottom-up changes are transforming food systems, driven by policies on SDGs and by consumer's concerns about environmental and health impacts. Food quality, in terms of taste, safety, and nutritional value, is determined by its composition, described in food composition databases (FDBs). FDBs are then useful resources to agronomists, food and mechanical engineers, nutritionists, marketers, and others in their efforts to address at maximum human nutrient needs. In this work, we analyse some relevant food composition databases (viz., purpose, type of data, ease of access, regularity of updates), inspecting information on the health and environmental nexus, such as food origin, production mode as well as nutritional quality. The usefulness and limitations of food databases are discussed regarding what concerns sustainable diets, the food 'matrix effect', missing compounds, safe processing, and in guiding innovation in foods, as well as in shaping consumers' perceptions and food choices.",

The altered gene expression of virus-infected host cells provides an opportunity to specifically inhibit viral propagation via targeting the synthetic lethal (SL) partners of such altered host genes. Pursuing this antiviral strategy, here we comprehensively analyzed multiple in vitro and in vivo bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict clinically relevant candidate antiviral targets that are SL with altered host genes. The predicted SL-based targets are highly enriched for infected cell inhibiting genes reported in four SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide genetic screens. Integrating our predictions with the results of these screens, we further selected a focused subset of 26 genes that we experimentally tested in a targeted siRNA screen using human Caco-2 cells. Notably, as predicted, knocking down these targets reduced viral replication and cell viability only under the infected condition without harming non-infected cells. Our results are made publicly available, to facilitate their in vivo testing and further validation.",

Exploring Systems Medicine implies understanding and combining concepts coming from diametral different fields, including medicine, biology, statistics, modeling and simulation, and data science. Such heterogeneity leads to semantic issues, which may slow down implementation and fruitful interaction between these highly diverse fields.\n\nMethods: In this review, we collect and explain more than100 terms related to Systems Medicine.

      "abstract": "A streaming assembly pipeline utilising real-time Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing data is important for saving sequencing resources and reducing time-to-result. A previous approach implemented in npScarf provided an efficient streaming algorithm for hybrid assembly but was relatively prone to mis-assemblies compared to other graph-based methods. Here we present npGraph, a streaming hybrid assembly tool using the assembly graph instead of the separated pre-assembly contigs. It is able to produce more complete genome assembly by resolving the path finding problem on the assembly graph using long reads as the traversing guide. Application to synthetic and real data from bacterial isolate genomes show improved accuracy while still maintaining a low computational cost. npGraph also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) which provides a real-time visualisation of the progress of assembly. The tool and source code is available at https://github.com/hsnguyen/assembly.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nHybrid genome assembly algorithms combine high accuracy short reads with error-prone long reads with the goal of generating highly contiguous assemblies with low error rates. Short read sequence data is relatively inexpensive in comparison to long-read sequence data, and, moreover short-read sequence data has already been collected for many bacterial species, thus motivating development of methods wh ich are frugal with respect to acquisition of long-read sequence data. One of the attractive features of the Oxford Nanopore Technology's sequencers is that they generate sequence data in real-time, and in principle sequencing can be stopped once enough data is acquired. However, there is only one previous attempt for greedy genome scaffolding of contigs in real-time, which was prone to assembly errors. In this paper we describe a new tool:npGraph:which resolves the assembly graph in real-time as sequence is generated; coupled with assembly visualisation showing assembly graph resolution in real-time. We show that npGraph generates completed bacterial assemblies which are as accurate as state-of-the-art batch hybrid assembly pipelines, and also provides substantial computational speed-up.",

However, an individual state of the art strategy, with precise adjustment to the patient's characteristics, is still far from being part of the everyday care of pwMS. The development of digital twins could decisively advance the necessary implementation of an individualized innovative management of MS. Through artificial intelligence-based analysis of several disease parameters - including clinical and para-clinical outcomes, multi-omics, biomarkers, patient-related data, information about the patient's life circumstances and plans, and medical procedures - a digital twin paired to the patient's characteristic can be created, enabling healthcare professionals to handle large amounts of patient data. This can contribute to a more personalized and effective care by integrating data from multiple sources in a standardized manner, implementing individualized clinical pathways, supporting physician-patient communication and facilitating a shared decision-making. With a clear display of pre-analyzed patient data on a dashboard, patient participation and individualized clinical decisions as well as the prediction of disease progression and treatment simulation could become possible. In this review, we focus on the advantages, challenges and practical aspects of digital twins in the management of MS. We discuss the use of digital twins for MS as a revolutionary tool to improve diagnosis, monitoring and therapy refining patients' well-being, saving economic costs, and enabling prevention of disease progression.

However, variations introduced during data generation and processing limit the comparisons among independent studies in respect of interpretability. Although multiple databases have been constructed as platforms for data reuse, they are of limited value since only raw sequencing files are considered.\n\nDescription\n\nHere, we present MetaGeneBank, a standardized database that provides details on sample collection and sequencing, and abundances of genes, microbiota and molecular functions for 4470 raw sequencing files (over 12 TB) collected from 16 studies covering over 10 types of diseases and 14 countries using a unified data-processing pipeline. The incorporation of tools that enable browsing and searching with descriptive attributes, gene sequences, microbiota and functions makes the database user-friendly. We found that the source of specimen contributes more than sequencing centers or platforms to the variations of microbiota. Special attention should be paid when re-analyzing sequencing files from different countries.\n\nConclusions\n\nCollectively, MetaGeneBank provides a gateway to utilize the untapped potential of gut metagenomic data in helping fighting against human diseases. With the continuous updating of the database in terms of data volume, data types and sample types, MetaGeneBank would undoubtedly be the benchmarking database in the future in respect of data reuse, and would be valuable in translational science.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12866-021-02321-z.",

Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.\n\nResults\n\nIn total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities.

      "abstract": "The initial aim of the research was to develop a framework that would enable architects to look for thermoregulation methods in nature as inspiration for designing energy efficient buildings. The thermo-bio-architectural framework (ThBA) assumes designers will start with a thermal challenge in a building and then look in a systematic way for how this same issue is solved in nature. The tool is thus a contribution to architectural biomimicry in the field of building energy use. Since the ThBA was created by an architect, it was essential that the biology side of this cross-disciplinary tool was validated by experts in biology. This article describes the focus group that was conducted to assess the quality, inclusiveness, and applicability of the framework and why a focus group was selected over other possible methods such as surveys or interviews. The article first provides a brief explanation of the development of the ThBA. Given the focus here is on its validation, the qualitative data collection procedures and analysis results produced by NVivo 12 plus through thematic coding are described in detail. The results showed the ThBA was effective in bridging the two fields based on the existing thermal challenges in buildings, and was comprehensive in terms of generalising biological thermal adaptation strategies.",

This study focused on the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) algorithm to predict the bearing capacity of driven pile. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed to select the most significant features in the raw dataset. After that, a GA-DLNN hybrid model was developed to select optimal parameters for the DLNN model, including: network algorithm, activation function for hidden neurons, number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer. A database containing 472 driven pile static load test reports was used. The dataset was divided into three parts, namely the training set (60%), validation (20%) and testing set (20%) for the construction, validation and testing phases of the proposed model, respectively. Various quality assessment criteria, namely the coefficient of determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), were used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) algorithms. The GA-DLNN hybrid model was shown to exhibit the ability to find the most optimal set of parameters for the prediction process.The results showed that the performance of the hybrid model using only the most critical features gave the highest accuracy, compared with those obtained by the hybrid model using all input variables.",

      "abstract": "The sooner disruptive emergent behaviors are detected, the sooner preventive measures can be taken to ensure the resilience of business processes execution. Therefore, organizations need to prepare for emergent behaviors by embedding corrective control mechanisms, which help coordinate organization-wide behavior (and goals) with the behavior of local autonomous entities. Ongoing technological advances, brought by the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems of systems paradigms, can support integration within complex enterprises, such as supply chains. In this paper, we propose a reference enterprise architecture for the detection and monitoring of emergent behaviors in enterprises. We focus on addressing the need for an adequate reaction to disruptions. Based on a systematic review of the literature on the topic of current architectural designs for understanding emergent behaviors, we distill architectural requirements. Our architecture is a hybrid as it combines distributed autonomous business logic (expressed in terms of simple business rules) and some central control mechanisms. We exemplify the instantiation and use of this architecture by means of a proof-of-concept implementation, using a multimodal logistics case study. The obtained results provide a basis for achieving supply chain resilience \"by design\", i.e., through the design of coordination mechanisms that are well equipped to absorb and compensate for the effects of emergent disruptive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Background\n\nSharing sensitive data across organizational boundaries is often significantly limited by legal and ethical restrictions. Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) impose strict requirements concerning the protection of personal and privacy sensitive data. Therefore new approaches, such as the Personal Health Train initiative, are emerging to utilize data right in their original repositories, circumventing the need to transfer data.\n\nResults\n\nCircumventing limitations of previous systems, this paper proposes a configurable and automated schema extraction and publishing approach, which enables ad-hoc SPARQL query formulation against RDF triple stores without requiring direct access to the private data. The approach is compatible with existing Semantic Web-based technologies and allows for the subsequent execution of such queries in a safe setting under the data provider's control. Evaluation with four distinct datasets shows that a configurable amount of concise and task-relevant schema, closely describing the structure of the underlying data, was derived, enabling the schema introspection-assisted authoring of SPARQL queries.\n\nConclusions\n\nAutomatically extracting and publishing data schema can enable the introspection-assisted creation of data selection and integration queries. In conjunction with the presented system architecture, this approach can enable reuse of data from private repositories and in settings where agreeing upon a shared schema and encoding a priori is infeasible. As such, it could provide an important step towards reuse of data from previously inaccessible sources and thus towards the proliferation of data-driven methods in the biomedical domain.",

These networks are often specializations of generic interaction sets, presenting opportunities for reducing storage and computational cost. Therefore, it is desirable to develop effective compression and storage techniques, along with efficient algorithms and a flexible query interface capable of operating on compressed data structures. Current graph databases offer varying levels of support for network integration. However, these solutions do not provide efficient methods for the storage and querying of versioned networks.\n\nResults\n\nWe present VerTIoN, a framework consisting of novel data structures and associated query mechanisms for integrated querying of versioned context-specific biological networks. As a use case for our framework, we study network proximity queries in which the user can select and compose a combination of tissue-specific and generic networks. Using our compressed version tree data structure, in conjunction with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, we demonstrate real-time querying of large network databases.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur results show that it is possible to support flexible queries defined on heterogeneous networks composed at query time while drastically reducing response time for multiple simultaneous queries. The flexibility offered by VerTIoN in composing integrated network versions opens significant new avenues for the utilization of ever increasing volume of context-specific network data in a broad range of biomedical applications.\n\nAvailability and Implementation\n\n VerTIoN is implemented as a C++ library and is available at http://compbio.case.edu/omics/software/vertion and https://github.com/tjcowman/vertion\n\nContact\n\ntyler.cowman@case.edu",

      "abstract": "Optimizing the gene transformation factors can be considered as the first and foremost step in successful genetic engineering and genome editing studies. However, it is usually difficult to achieve an optimized gene transformation protocol due to the cost and time-consuming as well as the complexity of this process. Therefore, it is necessary to use a novel computational approach such as machine learning models for analyzing gene transformation data. In the current study, three individual machine learning models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) were developed for forecasting Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation in chrysanthemum based on eleven input variables including Agrobacterium strain, optical density (OD), co-culture period (CCP), and different antibiotics including kanamycin (K), vancomycin (VA), cefotaxime (CF), hygromycin (H), carbenicillin (CA), geneticin (G), ticarcillin (TI), and paromomycin (P). Consequently, best-obtained results were used in the fusion process by bagging method. Results showed that ensemble model with the highest R2 (0.83) had superb performance in comparison with all other individual models (MLP:063, RBF:0.69, and ANFIS: 0.74) in the validation set. Also, ensemble model was linked to Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) for optimizing gene transformation, and the results showed that the maximum gene transformation efficiency (37.54%) can be achieved from EHA105 strain with 0.9 OD600, for 3.8 days CCP, 46.43 mg/l P, 9.54 mg/l K, 18.62 mg/l H, and 4.79 mg/l G as selection antibiotics and 109.74 mug/ml VA, 287.63 mug/ml CF, 334.07 mug/ml CA and 87.36 mug/ml TI as antibiotics in the selection medium. Moreover, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that input variables have a different degree of importance in gene transformation system in the order of Agrobacterium strain > CCP > K > CF > VA > P > OD > CA > H > TI > G. Generally, the developed hybrid model in this study (ensemble model-FOA) can be employed as an accurate and reliable approach in future genetic engineering and genome editing studies.",

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus is a havoc pandemic that infects millions of people over the world and thousands of infected cases dead. So, it is vital to propose new intelligent data analysis tools and enhance the existed ones to aid scientists in analyzing the COVID-19 virus. Fragmented Local Aligner Technique (FLAT) is a data analysis tool that is used for detecting the longest common consecutive subsequence (LCCS) between a pair of biological data sequences. FLAT is an aligner tool that can be used to find the LCCS between COVID-19 virus and other viruses to help in other biochemistry and biological operations. In this study, the enhancement of FLAT based on modified Ions Motion Optimization (IMO) is developed to produce acceptable LCCS with efficient performance in a reasonable time. The proposed method was tested to find the LCCS between Orflab poly-protein and surface glycoprotein of COVID-19 and other viruses. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model succeeded in producing the best LCCS against other algorithms using real LCCS measured by the SW algorithm as a reference.",

      "abstract": "Since the beginning of the 21st Century, synthetic biology has established itself as an effective technological approach to design and engineer biological systems. Whilst research and investment continues to develop the understanding, control and engineering infrastructural platforms necessary to tackle ever more challenging systems : and to increase the precision, robustness, speed and affordability of existing solutions : hundreds of start-up companies, predominantly in the US and UK, are already translating learnings and potential applications into commercially viable tools, services and products. Start-ups and SMEs have been the predominant channel for synthetic biology commercialisation to date, facilitating rapid response to changing societal interests and market pull arising from increasing awareness of health and global sustainability issues. Private investment in start-ups across the US and UK is increasing rapidly and now totals over $12bn. Health-related biotechnology applications have dominated the commercialisation of products to date, but significant opportunities for the production of bio-derived materials and chemicals, including consumer products, are now being developed. Synthetic biology start-ups developing tools and services account for between 10% (in the UK) and ~25% (in the US) of private investment activity. Around 20% of synthetic biology start-ups address industrial biotechnology targets, but currently, only attract ~11% private investment. Adopting a more networked approach : linking specialists, infrastructure and ongoing research to de-risk the economic challenges of scale-up and supported by an effective long-term funding strategy : is set to transform the impact of synthetic biology and industrial biotechnology in the bioeconomy.",

      "abstract": "Crude extracts and essential oils of A. conyzoides were tested with larva and adult stages of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to determine their insecticidal properties. The crude extracts and essential oils came from three varieties of A. conyzoides (with white flowers, purple flowers, or white-purple flowers) and from two places on each plant (leaves and flowers), giving six types overall: leaf-white (LW); leaf-purple (LP); leaf white-purple (LW-P); flower-white (FW); flower-purple (FP); and flower white-purple (FW-P). Chemical constituents and components of the essential oils were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Electron microscopic and histopathological studies were performed to determine the toxicological effects on mosquitoes in terms of morphological alterations. The six types of crude extracts exhibited no activity against individuals in the larval stages. However, six types of essential oils were effective against adult Ae. aegypti females. The mortality of adult Ae. aegypti females was higher from leaf extracts, particularly LP (median lethal dose, LD50 = 0.84%). The number of chemical constituents identified by GC-MS was high in flowers, especially W-P. Precocene I was the most abundant chemical component among the five types of essential oils, except in LP, in which precocene II was the most abundant. Histopathological alterations in adult Ae. aegypti females included compound eye degeneration, muscular damage with cellular infiltration, gut epithelial degeneration and necrosis, pyknotic nuclei in the malpighian epithelium and ovarian cell degeneration. FW and FP plant types exhibited the highest severity of histopathological alterations in mosquitoes compared with other plants, probably owing to the presence of monoterpene compounds in their tissues. The present study demonstrated LP plant extracts from A. conyzoides could be effective adulticides against adult Ae. aegypti. As natural products are biodegradable and exhibit low toxicity to mammalian and non-target organisms, they are suitable candidates for use in vector control programmes.",

The period between the first version of SEVA-DB and the present time has witnessed several technical, computational and conceptual advances in genetic/genomic engineering of prokaryotes that have enabled upgrading of the utilities of the updated database. Novelties include not only a more user-friendly web interface and many more plasmid vectors, but also new links of the plasmids to advanced bioinformatic tools. These provide an intuitive visualization of the constructs at stake and a range of virtual manipulations of DNA segments that were not possible before. Finally, the list of canonical SEVA plasmids is available in machine-readable SBOL (Synthetic Biology Open Language) format. This ensures interoperability with other platforms and affords simulations of their behaviour under different in vivo conditions. We argue that the SEVA-DB will remain a useful resource for extending Synthetic Biology approaches towards non-standard bacterial species as well as genetically programming new prokaryotic chassis for a suite of fundamental and biotechnological endeavours.",

To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.\n\nOver the past two decades, scientists from different fields have been developing SBML, a standard format for encoding computational models in biology and medicine.

      "abstract": "Background\n\nWhen new technologies are developed, it is common for their crime and security implications to be overlooked or given inadequate attention, which can lead to a 'crime harvest'. Potential methods for the criminal exploitation of biotechnology need to be understood to assess their impact, evaluate current policies and interventions and inform the allocation of limited resources efficiently. Recent studies have illustrated some of the security implications of biotechnology, with outcomes of misuse ranging from compromised computers using malware stored in synthesised DNA, infringement of intellectual property on biological matter, synthesis of new threatening viruses, 'genetic genocide,' and the exploitation of food markets with genetically modified crops. However, there exists no synthesis of this information, and no formal quality assessment of the current evidence. This review therefore aims to establish what current and/or predicted crimes have been reported as a result of biotechnology.\n\nMethods\n\nA systematic review will be conducted to identify relevant literature. ProQuest, Web of Science, MEDLINE and USENIX will be searched utilizing a predefined search string, and Backward and Forward searches. Grey literature will be identified by searching the official UK Government website (www.gov.uk) and the Global database of Dissertations and Theses. The review will be conducted by screening title/abstracts followed by full texts, utilising pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Papers will be managed using Eppi-center Reviewer 4 software, and data will be organised using a data extraction table using a descriptive coding tool. A predefined rating system (speculative, experimental or currently occurring) will be used to sort studies, and a thematic synthesis of the results will be presented.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite the concerns raised about the misuse of biotechnology, no previous work has been conducted from a Crime Science perspective to collate and assess the literature. This systematic review aims to identify the types of offending activity facilitated by biotechnology, including synthetic biology and genetic engineering. The objective of the review is to examine whether this offending activity can be prevented by assessing the conditions necessary for the crime events to occur. It is anticipated that evidence generated from this review will guide future research in this area and aid relevant stakeholders to prioritise and allocate limited resources to biotechnology crime prevention.\n\nSystematic review registration\n\nPROSPERO CRD42019131685",

In this update, a text-mining system was incorporated to enhance the recognition of MTI-related articles by adopting a scoring system. In addition, a variety of biological databases were integrated to provide information on the regulatory network of miRNAs and its expression in blood. Not only targets of miRNAs but also regulators of miRNAs are provided to users for investigating the up- and downstream regulations of miRNAs. Moreover, the number of MTIs with high-throughput experimental evidence increased remarkably (validated by CLIP-seq technology).

Efforts to mitigate biothreat require development of efficient countermeasures which in turn relies on fast and accurate methods to detect the biological agents in a range of complex matrices including environmental and clinical samples. We report here an mass spectrometry (MS) based methodology, employing both targeted and shot-gun approaches for the verification of biological agents from the environmental samples. Our shot-gun methodology relied on tandem MS analysis of abundant peptides from the spiked samples, whereas, the targeted method was based on an extensive elucidation of marker proteins and unique peptides resulting in the generation of an inclusion list of masses reflecting relevant peptides for the unambiguous identification of nine bacterial species [listed as priority agents of bioterrorism by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)] belonging to phylogenetically diverse genera. The marker peptides were elucidated by extensive literature mining, in silico analysis, and tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis of abundant proteins of the cultivated bacterial species in our laboratory. A combination of shot-gun MS/MS analysis and the targeted search using a panel of unique peptides is likely to provide unambiguous verification of biological agents at sub-species level, even with limited fractionation of crude protein extracts from environmental samples. The comprehensive list of peptides reflected in the inclusion list, makes a valuable resource for the multiplex analysis of select biothreat agents and further development of targeted MS/MS assays.",

      "abstract": "Microbial culture collections are very important components of biological science. They provide researchers with material for studies and preserve biological resources. One such collection is the Collection of Rhizosphere Microorganisms, kept at the Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Plants and Microorganisms of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Saratov (IBPPM). Its activity is primarily directed toward the isolation and preservation of microorganisms from the plant root zone. The international research interest in microorganisms from this ecological niche is not waning, because they are very important for plant growth and development and, consequently, for plant breeding. The group of bacteria with properties of significance for plants has been given the name \"plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria\" (PGPR). This group includes nitrogen-fixing soil alpha-proteobacteria of the genus Azospirillum, which form the core of the IBPPM collection. First discovered by Brazilian scientists in the 1970s, azospirilla are now a universally recognized model object for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-bacterium interactions. The broad range of useful properties found in these microorganisms, including the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, production of phytohormones, solubilization of phosphates, control of pathogens, and formation of induced systemic resistance in the colonized plants, make these bacteria an all-purpose tool that has been used for several decades in basic and applied research. This article reviews the current state of Azospirillum research, with emphasis on the results obtained at the IBPPM. Scientific expeditions across the Saratov region undertaken by IBPPM microbiologists in the early 1980s formed the basis for the unique collection of members of this bacterial taxon. Currently, the collection has more than 160 Azospirillum strains and is one of the largest collections in Europe. The research conducted at the IBPPM is centered mostly on the Azospirillum structures involved in associative symbiosis with plants, primarily extracellular polysaccharide-containing complexes and lectins. The development of immunochemical methods contributed much to our understanding of the overall organization of the surface of rhizosphere bacteria. The extensive studies of the Azospirillum genome largely deepened our understanding of the role of the aforesaid bacterial structures, motility, and biofilms in the colonization of host plant roots. Of interest are also applied studies focusing on agricultural and environmental technologies and on the \"green\" synthesis of Au, Ag, and Se nanoparticles. The Collection of Rhizosphere Microorganisms continues to grow, being continually supplemented with newly isolated strains. The data presented in this article show the great importance of specialized microbial culture repositories, such as the IBPPM collection, for the development and maintenance of the microbial research base and for the effective solution of basic and applied tasks in microbiology.",

      "abstract": "Viruses represent important test cases for data federation due to their genome size and the rapid increase in sequence data in publicly available databases. However, some consequences of previously decentralized (unfederated) data are lack of consensus or comparisons between feature annotations. Unifying or displaying alternative annotations should be a priority both for communities with robust entry representation and for nascent communities with burgeoning data sources. To this end, during this three-day continuation of the Virus Hunting Toolkit codeathon series (VHT-2), a new integrated and federated viral index was elaborated. This Federated Index of Viral Experiments (FIVE) integrates pre-existing and novel functional and taxonomy annotations and virus-host pairings. Variability in the context of viral genomic diversity is often overlooked in virus databases. As a proof-of-concept, FIVE was the first attempt to include viral genome variation for HIV, the most well-studied human pathogen, through viral genome diversity graphs. As per the publication of this manuscript, FIVE is the first implementation of a virus-specific federated index of such scope. FIVE is coded in BigQuery for optimal access of large quantities of data and is publicly accessible. Many projects of database or index federation fail to provide easier alternatives to access or query information. To this end, a Python API query system was developed to enhance the accessibility of FIVE.",

      "abstract": "Summary\n\nRobust synthetic biology applications rely heavily on the design and assembly of DNA parts with specific functionalities based on engineering principles. However, the assembly standards adopted by different communities vary considerably, thus limiting the interoperability of parts, vectors and methods. We hereby introduce the SEVA 3.1 platform consisting of the SEVA 3.1 vectors and the Golden Gate-based 'SevaBrick Assembly'. This platform enables the convergence of standard processes between the SEVA platform, the BioBricks and the Type IIs-mediated DNA assemblies to reduce complexity and optimize compatibility between parts and methods. It features a wide library of cloning vectors along with a core set of standard SevaBrick primers that allow multipart assembly and exchange of short functional genetic elements (promoters, RBSs) with minimal cloning and design effort. As proof of concept, we constructed, among others, multiple sfGFP expression vectors under the control of eight RBSs, eight promoters and four origins of replication as well as an inducible four-gene operon expressing the biosynthetic genes for the black pigment proviolacein. To demonstrate the interoperability of the SEVA 3.1 vectors, all constructs were characterized in both Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. In summary, the SEVA 3.1 platform optimizes compatibility and modularity of inserts and backbones with a cost- and time-friendly DNA assembly method, substantially expanding the toolbox for successful synthetic biology applications in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nWe hereby introduce the SEVA 3.1 platform consisting of the SEVA 3.1 vectors and the Golden Gate-based 'SevaBrick assembly'.

      "title": "Revealing Relationships Among Cognitive Functions Using Functional Connectivity and a Large-Scale Meta-Analysis Database",
      "abstract": "To characterize each cognitive function per se and to understand the brain as an aggregate of those functions, it is vital to relate dozens of these functions to each other. Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as 'emotion,' 'attention,' 'episodic memory,' etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Opening up connectivity between documents, structures and bioactivity",
      "abstract": "Bioscientists reading papers or patents strive to discern the key relationships reported within a document \"D\" where a bioactivity \"A\" with a quantitative result \"R\" (e.g., an IC50) is reported for chemical structure \"C\" that modulates (e.g., inhibits) a protein target \"P\". A useful shorthand for this connectivity thus becomes DARCP. The problem at the core of this article is that the community has spent millions effectively burying these relationships in PDFs over many decades but must now spend millions more trying to get them back out. The key imperative for this is to increase the flow into structured open databases. The positive impacts will include expanded data mining opportunities for drug discovery and chemical biology. Over the last decade commercial sources have manually extracted DARCP from  300,000 documents encompassing  7 million compounds interacting with  10,000 targets. Over a similar time, the Guide to Pharmacology, BindingDB and ChEMBL have carried out analogues DARCP extractions. Although their expert-curated numbers are lower (i.e.,  2 million compounds against  3700 human proteins), these open sources have the great advantage of being merged within PubChem. Parallel efforts have focused on the extraction of document-to-compound (D-C-only) connectivity. In the absence of molecular mechanism of action (mmoa) annotation, this is of less value but can be automatically extracted. This has been significantly accomplished for patents, (e.g., by IBM, SureChEMBL and WIPO) for over 30 million compounds in PubChem. These have recently been joined by 1.4 million D-C submissions from three major chemistry publishers. In addition, both the European and US PubMed Central portals now add chemistry look-ups from abstracts and full-text papers. However, the fully automated extraction of DARCLP has not yet been achieved. This stands in contrast to the ability of biocurators to discern these relationships in minutes. Unfortunately, no journals have yet instigated a flow of author-specified DARCP directly into open databases. Progress may come from trends such as open science, open access (OA), findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), resource description framework (RDF) and WikiData. However, we will need to await the technical applicability in respect to DARCP capture to see if this opens up connectivity.",

      "title": "The 'migratory connectivity' concept, and its applicability to insect migrants",
      "abstract": "Migratory connectivity describes the degree of linkage between different parts of an animal's migratory range due to the movement trajectories of individuals. High connectivity occurs when individuals from one particular part of the migratory range move almost exclusively to another localized part of the migratory range with little mixing with individuals from other regions. Conversely, low migratory connectivity describes the situation where individuals spread over a wide area during migration and experience a large degree of mixing with individuals from elsewhere. The migratory connectivity concept is frequently applied to vertebrate migrants (especially birds), and it is highly relevant to conservation and management of populations. However, it is rarely employed in the insect migration literature, largely because much less is known about the migration circuits of most migratory insects than is known about birds. In this review, we discuss the applicability of the migratory connectivity concept to long-range insect migrations. In contrast to birds, insect migration circuits typically comprise multigenerational movements of geographically unstructured (non-discrete) populations between broad latitudinal zones. Also, compared to the faster-flying birds, the lower degree of control over movement directions would also tend to reduce connectivity in many insect migrants. Nonetheless, after taking account of these differences, we argue that the migratory connectivity framework can still be applied to insects, and we go on to consider postulated levels of connectivity in some of the most intensively studied insect migrants. We conclude that a greater understanding of insect migratory connectivity would be of value for conserving threatened species and managing pests.",

      "abstract": "NMR-based metabolomics requires proper identification of metabolites to draw conclusions from the system under study. Normally, multivariate data analysis is performed using 1D 1H NMR spectra, and identification of peaks (and then compounds) relevant to the classification is accomplished using database queries as a first step. 1D 1H NMR spectra of complex mixtures often suffer from peak overlap. To overcome this issue, several studies employed the projections of the (tilted and symmetrized) 2D 1H J-resolved (JRES) spectra, p-JRES, which are similar to 1D 1H decoupled spectra. Nonetheless, there are no public databases available that allow searching for chemical shift spectral data for multiplets. We present the Chemical Shift Multiplet Database (CSMDB), built utilizing JRES spectra obtained from the Birmingham Metabolite Library. The CSMDB provides scoring accounting for both matched and unmatched peaks from a query list and the database hits. This input list is generated from a projection of a 2D statistical correlation analysis on the JRES spectra, p-(JRES-STOCSY), being able to compare the multiplets for the matched peaks, in essence, the f1 traces from the JRES-STOCSY spectrum and from the database hit. The inspection of the unmatched peaks for the database hit allows the retrieval of peaks in the query list that have a decreased correlation coefficient due to low intensities. The CSMDB is coupled to \"ConQuer ABC\", which permits the assessment of biological correlation by means of consecutive queries with the unmatched peaks in the first and subsequent queries.",

In many biological applications, such as digital pathology and cryo-EM, often identifying specific local regions of images is of particular interest. Therefore, finding invariant descriptors that can efficiently retrieve local image patches or subimages becomes necessary.\n\nResults\n\nWe present a software package called Two-Dimensional Krawtchouk Descriptors that allows to perform local subimage search in 2D images. The new toolkit uses only a small number of invariant descriptors per image for efficient local image retrieval. This enables querying an image and comparing similar patterns locally across a potentially large database. We show that these descriptors appear to be useful for searching local patterns or small particles in images and demonstrate some test cases that can be helpful for both assembly software developers and their users.\n\nConclusions\n\nLocal image comparison and subimage search can prove cumbersome in both computational complexity and runtime, due to factors such as the rotation, scaling, and translation of the object in question. By using the 2DKD toolkit, relatively few descriptors are developed to describe a given image, and this can be achieved with minimal memory usage.",

To do this, we first introduce a database for a protocol retrieval system constructed from individual protocol data extracted from 184,634 clinical trials and 13,210 frame structures of clinical trial protocols. The database contains a variety of semantic information that allows the filtering of protocols during the search operation. Based on the database, we developed a web application called the clinical trial protocol database system (CLIPS; available at https://corus.kaist.edu/clips). This system enables an interactive search by utilizing protocol elements. To enable an interactive search for combinations of protocol elements, CLIPS provides optional next element selection according to the previous element in the form of a connected tree.

For example, the scale of harm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates the potential impact of future biocrime and highlights the need for prevention strategies. Systematic evidence quantifying the crime opportunities posed by synthetic biology has to date been very limited. Here, we systematically reviewed forms of crime that could be facilitated by synthetic biology with a view to informing their prevention. A total of 794 articles from four databases were extracted and a three-step screening phase resulted in 15 studies that met our threshold criterion for thematic synthesis. Within those studies, 13 exploits were identified. Of these, 46% were dependent on technologies characteristic of synthetic biology. Eight potential crime types emerged from the studies: bio-discrimination, cyber-biocrime, bio-malware, biohacking, at-home drug manufacturing, illegal gene editing, genetic blackmail, and neuro-hacking. 14 offender types were identified. For the most commonly identified offenders (>3 mentions) 40% were outsider threats. These observations suggest that synthetic biology presents substantial new offending opportunities.

We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that these maps highly resolve the cis-regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression. Finally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.\n\nHigh-resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites from 733 human biosamples are used to identify and index regulatory DNA within the human genome.",

Many of these databases are still available, but suffer accessibility issues such as link rot, thus putting the information they contain in danger of being lost.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe Omics Discovery Index is an open source platform that can be used to access, discover and disseminate omics datasets. OmicsDI integrates proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, models and transcriptomics datasets. Using an efficient indexing system, OmicsDI integrates different biological entities including genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites and the corresponding publications from PubMed. In addition, it implements a group of pipelines to estimate the impact of each dataset by tracing the number of citations, reanalysis and biological entities reported by each dataset. Here, we present the OmicsDI REST interface (www.omicsdi.org/ws/) to enable programmatic access to any dataset in OmicsDI or all the datasets for a specific provider (database). Clients can perform queries on the API using different metadata information such as sample details (species, tissues, etc), instrumentation (mass spectrometer, sequencer), keywords and other provided annotations. In addition, we present two different libraries in R and Python to facilitate the development of tools that can programmatically interact with the OmicsDI REST interface.",

      "abstract": "Research highlights\n\nPatent documents are a signalling mechanism about innovation values.\n\nExtant patent valuation literature tends to overlook the public value of innovation.\n\nBoth private and public value propositions are found in patent documents.\n\nPublic value propositions are less frequent but more diverse.\n\nAnalysing private and public values in patents offers innovation policy insights.\n\nEmerging science and technology fields are increasingly expected to provide solutions to societal grand challenges. The promise of such solutions frequently underwrites claims for the public funding of research. In parallel, universities, public research organizations and, in particular, private enterprises draw on such research to actively secure property rights over potential applications through patenting. Patents represent a claim to garner financial returns from the novel outcomes of science and technology. This is justified by the potential social value promised by patents as they encourage information sharing, further R&D investment, and the useful application of new knowledge. Indeed, the value of patents has generated longstanding academic interest in innovation studies with many scholars investigating its determinants based on econometric models. Yet, this research has largely focused on evaluating factors that influence the market value of patents and the gains from exclusivity rights granted to inventions, which reflect the private value of a patent. However, the patent system is a socially shaped enterprise where private and public concerns intersect. Despite the notion of the social utility of inventions as a patenting condition, and evidence of disconnection between societal needs and the goals of private actors, less attention has been paid to other interpretations of patent value. This paper investigates the various articulations of value delineated by patents in an emerging science and technology domain. As a pilot study, we analyse patents in synthetic biology, contributing a new analytical framework and classification of private and public values at the intersections of science, economy, and society. After considering the legal, business, social and political dimensions of patenting, we undertake a qualitative and systematic examination of patent content in synthetic biology. Our analysis probes the private and public value propositions that are framed in these patents in terms of the potential private and public benefits of research and innovation. Based on this framework, we shed light on questions of what values are being nurtured in inventions in synthetic biology and discuss how attention to public as well as private values opens up promising avenues of research in science, technology and innovation policy.",

A large proportion of CAZyme genes were cataloged into glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, and carbohydrate esterases. The predicted BGCs of Trametes were divided into six strategies, and the nine Trametes strains harbored 47.78 BGCs on average. Our study revealed that Trametes exhibits an open pan-genome structure.

      "abstract": "The conceptual framework for Data Transportability, builds on the premise that well-designed studies conducted for the environmental and food/feed risk assessment of transgenic crops may be transportable across geographies. Beyond individual data, provided that certain criteria are met, the general conclusions of comparative assessments of a transgenic crop with its conventional counterpart would also be transportable. In spite of this, many regulatory agencies still require in-country field trials to complete risk assessments of transgenic crops. A sub-team from ILSI Argentina's (International Life Sciences Institute, Argentina. www.ilsi.org.ar) Biotechnology Working Group tested the applicability of the transportability concept to the case of the golden mosaic virus-resistant transgenic bean, developed by EMBRAPA (EMBRAPA: Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). To this end, regulatory confined field trials (CFTs) carried out in Brazil to gather agro-phenotypic and compositional data were analyzed. The transportability of the conclusions of these studies to the bean cropping areas in Argentina was assessed as a conceptual exercise (with no intention to conclude on the biosafety of the common bean event). Comparative studies included the transgenic bean and its conventional parental line and were run in different agroecological environments so that any relevant differences could be observed. The main criteria to enable transportability were set by the sub-team and found to be met by the CFTs carried out in Brazil to inform a potential risk evaluation for Argentina.",

However, they are different in the contents and compositions of lycopodium alkaloids. In this study, the biosynthesis related genes of lycopodium alkaloids and genetic markers are discovered in L. casuarinoides transcriptome.\n\nMethods\n\nThe plant of L. casuarinoides was collected and was subjected to the RNA isolation, cDNA library construction, high throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.\n\nResults\n\nTotally 124, 524 high-quality unigenes were assembled from RNA sequencing reads, with an average sequence length of 601 bp. Among the L. casuarinoides transcripts, 61,304 shared the significant similarity (E-value < 10-5) with existing protein sequences in the public databases. From 124,524 unigenes, 47,538 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted. Based on the bioinformatics analysis, all possible enzyme genes involved in the lycodine-type alkaloids biosynthetic pathway of L. casuarinoides were identified, including lysine decarboxylase (LDC), primary amine oxidase (PAO), malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, etc. Sixty-four putative cytochrome p450 (CYP) and 827 putative transcription factors were selected from the transcriptome unigenes as the candidates of lycodine-type alkaloids biosynthesis modifiers. Furthermore, 13,352 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified from 124,524 unigenes, of which dinucleotide motifs AG/CT were the most abundant (50.1%). Meanwhile, we confirmed the amplification effectiveness of 25 PCR primer pairs for randomly selected SSRs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe obtained the comprehensive transcriptomic information from the high throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, which provided a valuable resource of transcript sequences of L. casuarinoides in public databases.",

This has led to the next challenge in this research field: retrieving biochemical pathway information from the various types of networks that can be constructed from metabolome data. Searching putative biochemical pathways, referred to as biotransformation paths, is complicated because several flaws occur during the construction of metabolome networks. Multiple network analysis tools have been developed to deal with these flaws, while in silico retrosynthesis is appearing as an alternative approach.

For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed MAAs of small molecule drugs assessed by the EMA between January 2014 and December 2017. As per two key requirements in the EMA's guideline, we analyzed cases where (i) a single functionally polymorphic drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) metabolizes > 25% of the drug, or (ii) the drug's PK shows high interindividual variability not explained by other factors than PG. Results showed that, of 113 drugs analyzed, 53 (47%) had >= 1 functionally polymorphic DME accounting for > 25% of the drug's metabolism, yielding 55 gene-drug pairs. For 36 of 53 (68%) of the products, CYP3A4 was the major DME. Compliance with European Union (EU) guidance on PG-PK issues in drug development was notably different for CYP3A4 substrates vs. non-CYP3A4 substrates. Adequate PG-PK data were provided during registration in 89% (16/18) of cases concerning non-CYP3A4 substrates, compared with 32% (12/37) of cases concerning CYP3A4 substrates. Concluding, PG-PK interactions related to non-CYP3A4 substrate drugs were, in general, addressed adequately in EU MAAs. PG-PK information on CYP3A4 substrates was available less frequently, despite some available evidence on the functional relevance of CYP3A4 polymorphisms. A more harmonized approach toward assessment of PG-PK issues in EU MAAs seems warranted, and a discussion on the relevance of CYP3A4 polymorphisms, such as CYP3A4*22, is recommended.",

Yet, parsing metabolomics data in the absence of in-house computational scientists can be overwhelming and time-consuming. As a consequence of manual data processing, the results are often not analysed in full depth, so potential novel findings might get lost.\n\nMethods\n\nTo tackle this problem, we developed Metabolite AutoPlotter, a tool to process and visualise quantified metabolite data. Other than with bulk data visualisations, such as heat maps, the aim of the tool is to generate single plots for each metabolite. For this purpose, it reads as input pre-processed metabolite-intensity tables and accepts different experimental designs, with respect to the number of metabolites, conditions and replicates. The code was written in the R-scripting language and wrapped into a shiny application that can be run online in a web browser on https://mpietzke.shinyapps.io/autoplotter.\n\nResults\n\nWe demonstrate the main features and the ease of use with two different metabolite datasets, for quantitative experiments and for stable isotope tracing experiments. We show how the plots generated by the tool can be interactively modified with respect to plot type, colours, text labels and the shown statistics. We also demonstrate the application towards 13C-tracing experiments and the seamless integration of natural abundance correction, which facilitates the better interpretation of stable isotope tracing experiments. The output of the tool is a zip-file containing one single plot for each metabolite as well as restructured tables that can be used for further analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the help of Metabolite AutoPlotter, it is now possible to simplify data processing and visualisation for a wide audience. High-quality plots from complex data can be generated in a short time by pressing a few buttons. This offers dramatic improvements over manual analysis. It is significantly faster and allows researchers to spend more time interpreting the results or to perform follow-up experiments. Further, this eliminates potential copy-and-paste errors or tedious repetitions when things need to be changed. We are sure that this tool will help to improve and speed up scientific discoveries.",

In the second part, we describe protocols for using the OMA browser to find a specific gene and its various types of orthologs. By the end of the Primer, readers should be able to (i) understand homology and the different types of orthologs reported in OMA, (ii) understand the best type of orthologs to use for a particular analysis; (iii) find particular genes of interest in the OMA browser; and (iv) identify orthologs for a given gene.  The data can be freely accessed from the OMA browser at https://omabrowser.org.",

      "abstract": "Background:\n\nResearchers are generating molecular data pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its proteins at an unprecedented rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into \"annotation tracks\" where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis.\n\nResults:\n\nThe UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day.\n\nConclusions:\n\nWe invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data. Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.",
