# SynBioPartsDB: A Locally-Deployable Database with Semantic Search for Engineering-Oriented Synthetic Biology Parts

## Abstract
**Motivation**: The efficient reuse of genetic parts in synthetic biology requires reliable, experimentally validated components. However, existing databases often lack comprehensive validation data and efficient search capabilities, making it challenging to identify suitable parts for engineering applications.

**Results**: We present SynBioPartsDB, a comprehensive database containing 19,850 experimentally validated synthetic biology parts with documented engineering applications. The database features a novel three-level classification system and semantic search powered by the Text-to-Gene Embedding model. Key features include: (1) standardized annotations for all entries, (2) local deployment support using SQLite, (3) vector-based semantic search, and (4) a user-friendly web interface. The database significantly improves part discovery efficiency through context-aware searching and hierarchical organization.

**Availability and Implementation**: SynBioPartsDB is freely available at https://github.com/[organization]/synbiopartsdb. The system is implemented in Python with a Streamlit interface, packaged as a Docker container for easy deployment. Documentation and example data are provided. The database and all source code are released under the MIT license.

**Supplementary Information**: Supplementary data includes detailed classification schemas, benchmark results, and usage examples.

## 1 Introduction

Synthetic biology relies heavily on well-characterized genetic parts for engineering biological systems. While several part repositories exist, they often focus on theoretical annotations rather than experimental validation. Additionally, traditional keyword-based searches often miss functionally similar parts due to terminology variations.

SynBioPartsDB addresses these challenges by providing:
- A curated collection of 19,850 experimentally validated parts
- A comprehensive three-level classification system
- Semantic search capabilities for efficient part discovery
- Local deployment options for secure access

## 2 Features

### 2.1 Data Content
- 12,509 coding sequences with validated expression
- 6,666 DNA elements with characterized functionality
- 534 RNA elements with confirmed activities
- 134 application-ready genetic circuits
- Complete sequence information and experimental validation data

### 2.2 Classification System
The database implements a three-level hierarchy:
- Level 1: Major categories (DNA/RNA/Protein/Application)
- Level 2: Functional classes (e.g., Regulatory, Structural)
- Level 3: Specific types (e.g., Promoters, Terminators)

### 2.3 Search Capabilities
- Semantic search using Text-to-Gene Embedding
- Context-aware result ranking
- Faceted filtering by part types and properties
- Sequence similarity search

### 2.4 User Interface
- Web-based interface built with Streamlit
- Bulk data export in standard formats
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Detailed part visualization

## 3 Implementation

SynBioPartsDB is implemented using:
- Python 3.8+ for core functionality
- SQLite for data storage
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Streamlit for web interface
- Docker for deployment

System requirements:
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 10GB disk space
- Linux/macOS/Windows with Docker support

## 4 Usage Example

```python
# Initialize database connection
from synbiopartsdb import SynBioPartsDB
db = SynBioPartsDB()

# Semantic search for parts
results = db.semantic_search(
    "strong constitutive promoter for E. coli",
    part_type="DNA Elements",
    limit=10
)

# Export results
db.export_parts(results, format="genbank")
```

## 5 Conclusion

SynBioPartsDB provides a comprehensive solution for managing and discovering synthetic biology parts, with emphasis on experimental validation and ease of deployment. The semantic search capabilities and standardized classification system significantly improve the efficiency of part selection for engineering applications.
